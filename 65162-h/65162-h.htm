<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>A small boy coming down to the drawing-room
at half-past five for the sacred hour of play, found
a visitor absorbing his mother&#8217;s attention. For
five minutes or so he politely refrained from interrupting
their conversation, and he wandered about
the room, a little disconsolate perhaps, but in that
state of being described by nurses as &#8220;not a bit of
trouble.&#8221; When, however, the five minutes lengthened
into ten, he felt that direct action of some sort
was imperative. So he advanced upon the lingering
guest, laid small, imperative hands upon her
knee; and lifting an anxious face to hers, enquired
in honeyed tones: &#8220;Is you going to stay very much
longer?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was in the forgotten, by some regretted, by
many derided, nineties.</p>

<p>The other day I was having tea with a charming
friend, wise mother of many sons, when the
youngest, aged two, came for the sacred hour. It
was pleasant in that drawing-room and I made no
haste to go. Whereupon he came to me and, with
a gracious, even a gallant, gesture, held out his hand
to me with the utmost friendliness, conversing the
while perpetually and emphatically in a manner
difficult for the uninitiated to follow. Pleased and
flattered, I took the kind little hand, which pulled
me to my feet. He then firmly led me to the door
and out to the top of the staircase, and was preparing
to escort me downstairs and to the front
door, when his mother ran after us and fetched us
back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>Whatever else is changing in the present; bewildering
world, there is one section of the community
that is essentially Conservative, not to say &#8220;Die
Hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside my window there is a long, straggling
street of old cottages which have altered very little
since the fourteenth century, and in those little old
houses dwell many children who play in the street,
games that were doubtless popular &#8220;in Thebes&#8217;s
streets three thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The adult attitude towards children has changed
even during the last fifty years, and largely for the
better. Yet the child&#8217;s attitude towards his playmate,
and even towards the omniscient grown-up,
is fundamentally what it has been throughout the
ages.</p>

<p>The early nineteenth century is often quoted by
deprecators of the twentieth as a time when the
attitude of youth towards age was particularly
praiseworthy in its modesty and reverence. Such
people, who are perhaps a little prone to forget
their own youthful viewpoint, tell us that in those
golden days children accepted without question the
opinions of those who were set in authority over
them, and were almost invariably obedient, contented
and unenterprising. Yet, researches in the
literature published especially for children by that
&#8220;friend of youth,&#8221; John Newbery, at &#8220;the corner
of St. Paul&#8217;s Churchyard,&#8221; in his little &#8220;gilt books&#8221;&mdash;most
of them published between 1745 and 1802&mdash;prove
that badly-behaved children were by no
means uncommon, and that over-indulgent parents
were not unknown. In the &#8220;Histories of More
Children than One; or, Goodness Better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
Beauty,&#8221; Master John and Miss Mary Strictum,
who, as their names imply, are models of deportment,
are unfavorably contrasted with Master
Thomas and Miss Kitty Bloomer.</p>

<p>Thomas insists upon his papa&#8217;s horse being
brought into the parlour for him to ride round the
room. His mamma tried &#8220;to persuade him not to
want it, but he would have his own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas was much pleased to have it, but Kitty
was afraid of it and did not like that it should stay.
She therefore began to scream and beg it might go
out. &#8216;Pray take it out!&#8217; said she. &#8216;It shall go
out; it shan&#8217;t stay.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It shan&#8217;t go out. It shall stay!&#8217; said her
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;They made such a noise that they frightened
the horse, and he began to kick and prance,&#8221; and
all manner of disasters followed. Not even the
most weak-minded modern parent could go further
than this in the way of indulgence.</p>

<p>Even in so didactic a work as &#8220;The First Principles
of Religion and the <i>Existence of a Deity Explained
in a Series of Dialogues Adapted to the
Capacity of the Infant Mind</i>,&#8221; you will find a child
as human and engaging as any infant born since
the Armistice. In this work the particular infant
selected for enlightenment is one Maria, made after
no formal pattern. Throughout the long and deadly
dialogues her nimble mind outpaces mamma&#8217;s ponderous
aphorisms. As, when that lady discourses
on the awful consequences of taking God&#8217;s name in
vain, Maria demands demurely: &#8220;But would it not
be politer and prettier to say either Mr. or Mrs.,
and not plain God?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>Again, when her mother, as an example of the
evils of slyness, relates how &#8220;the two Misses Quick
had pincushions of the same make, but Miss Betty&#8217;s
was larger than Miss Sally&#8217;s,&#8221; and Miss Sally by a
subterfuge manages to exchange her own for her
sister&#8217;s, Maria says thoughtfully: &#8220;Do you think
then, Mamma, that it signifies to God which of the
Miss Quicks had the larger pincushion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Could the most recent Realist ask a more searching
question?</p>

<p>At Christmas time the papers seemed full of descriptions
of <i>blas&eacute;</i> children who insisted on going to
expensive shops to choose their own presents, who
scoffed at fairies or Santa Claus, and scouted the
idea of any sort of childlike party. I do not move
in plutocratic circles, so I cannot vouch for either
the truth or falsehood of these dismal revelations.
But I do know that the vast majority of gently-bred
children born before and during the years that
followed 1914 are easily pleased, and are grateful
for very small mercies in the way of amusement,
because nothing else is possible to the greater part
of the upper middle class for financial reasons.
And no one who, in recent years, has been to &#8220;Peter
Pan&#8221; and looked round the crowded theatre gloriously
garlanded with chubby, rosy faces, and heard
the full-throated affirmative that greets the question
&#8220;Do you believe in fairies?&#8221; can doubt that
children are still pretty sound on subjects of that sort.</p>

<p>This being so, is it incredibly bold or superlatively
simple, on my part, to have ventured to collect
into a little sheaf some fugitive sketches of the
kind of children I have known during the last
twenty-five years?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>Perhaps it is, and that being so, I can only quote
the lines in which Mr. Kipling has once and for all
time summed up the humble plea of the free-lance:</p>

<h4>I<br />

THE MURDER</h4>

<p>By the people who live in the same terrace they
are known as &#8220;those dreadful twins.&#8221; By the
more plain-spoken of the masters at the preparatory
school which they attend they are distinguished
by an adjective whose meaning is the
reverse of &#8220;heavenly&#8221;; and their schoolfellows
are filled with respectful admiration for the boys,
the most resourcefully and superfluously naughty
of their acquaintance, whose genius for making the
most patient of masters lose his temper is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>The only person who takes them and their ways
with calm philosophy is their mother. She, with
that sense of proportion and balanced wisdom so
frequently vouchsafed to mothers of large families,
laughs and loves them, and believes in their
ultimate regeneration. There is some ground for
the faith that is in her; for when a woman has
seen six sons fare forth into the world to cut no
such indifferent figure in it, she is not apt to despair
of the two youngest, roister they never so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Moreover, she declares that most of their evil
doings are &#8220;really Mr. Stevenson&#8217;s fault,&#8221; and
there is truth in the charge, for from the moment
that some thoughtless person, probably a godfather
(I have known godfathers, living at a distance,
who would present trumpets, nay, even
concertinas! to the sons of men whom they have
called by the name of friend), gave Peter a copy
of &#8220;The Merry Men&#8221; and Tod &#8220;Treasure Island,&#8221;
they have tried to fit their surroundings to the
characters they are forever enacting; with the
result that the plain workaday world, that knows
not the &#8220;Master Mage&#8221; of Samoa, is always
puzzled and generally wroth.</p>

<p>That genial &#8220;spirit of boyhood&#8221; had never so
much as to beckon to them; he had but to hold out
his friendly hands, and Tod and Peter, each clasping
one in both their own, were his, body and soul,
forevermore.</p>

<p>They are alike as the two Dromios, these twins;
and the mistakes and complications arising from
this likeness are a never-failing source of satisfaction
to them. For instance, Peter will cheerfully
undergo a caning intended for Tod that he may
afterwards meekly demand of his chastener what
he has done to deserve this discipline, gleefully
watching the while the weary wonder on the
master&#8217;s face grow to a disgusted certainty that he
has, as usual, &#8220;punished the wrong one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that they are rather noticeably comely
boys&mdash;they came of a family where on both sides
of the house good looks are the invariable rule&mdash;only
serves to increase the confusion. Both are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
tall and straight, fair-haired, blue-eyed, ruddy,
and of a uniformly cheerful countenance. But
kind Nature has bestowed on Tod an accomplishment
she has denied to Peter, to his lasting grief.</p>

<p>At certain seasons of the year Tod &#8220;moults&#8221;
and can pull out quantities of his thick fair hair
without the slightest inconvenience to himself. He
generally chooses to perform this feat during the
silent hours of &#8220;prep.&#8221; They have done their
evening work at school ever since the night they
were discovered grilling &#8220;Home Influence&#8221; and
&#8220;A Mother&#8217;s Recompense&#8221; over the study fire,
when they ought to have been wrestling with
&#8220;Excerpta Facilia.&#8221; When the master in charge
has walked down to the end of the long schoolroom
where Tod &#8220;keeps,&#8221; and has turned to go
back again, Tod is suddenly seized by a perfect
paroxysm of despair, clutches at his hair with
frantic though absolute noiseless gesticulations,
and casts whole handfuls of fluffy curls on the
floor about him.</p>

<p>Naturally his companions, including Peter, get
lines for disturbing the placidity of &#8220;prep&#8221; with
their unseemly giggles. And George, when he
sweeps up the schoolroom next morning, may be
heard to mutter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever all this &#8217;air do come from passes
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tod&#8217;s real name is Percy&mdash;he is called after a
wealthy and aristocratic relative&mdash;but he refuses
point-blank to answer to it, for he fancies that it
savours of those &#8220;eeny peeny&#8221; children in &#8220;Home
Influence,&#8221; a work that earned their undying hatred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
when it was read aloud to them by a well-intentioned
but mistaken aunt while they were
recovering from measles.</p>

<p>On the occasion of its holocaust, before referred
to, their mother, passing the study, and struck by
the unwonted stillness reigning therein, opened the
door softly and looked in. Both boys were stooping
over the fireplace and prodding a solid yet
feathery mass that glowed and gloomed in the
heart of the embers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes Herbert, &#8216;the almost-angel boy,&#8217;
and &#8216;haughty Caroline,&#8217; and &#8216;playful Emmiline,&#8217;&#8221;
whispered Tod, poking viciously. While Peter,
quoting from &#8220;Thrawn Janet,&#8221; added in an awful
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Witch, beldame, devil! I charge you, by the
power of God, begone&mdash;if you be dead, to the
grave&mdash;if you be damned, to hell.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I regret to say that their mother&#8217;s sense of humor
is stronger than her dislike of strong language,
and that she stole away to laugh, leaving
the conspirators unrebuked for the moment. But
they did their &#8220;prep.&#8221; at school henceforth.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s manner is singularly misleading in its
frank sincerity, and he will on occasion answer a
sudden question in a way which is, to say the least
of it, bewildering to his interlocutor.</p>

<p>For instance, one day in the football-field a new
master asked him the name of a small boy some
distance off who was &#8220;slacking&#8221; abominably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that chap with the red hair by the goal
posts?&#8221; he said to Peter, who had been somewhat
officiously putting him right on several points.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>&#8220;Dumpkins, sir,&#8221; that youth replied, demurely,
and strolled off to a distant part of the playground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dumpkins!&#8221; bawled the master. &#8220;Dumpkins,
why aren&#8217;t you playing up?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dumpkins heeded not the voice of authority
and continued to loll and gaze heavenward in easy
inactivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dumpkins! Dump-kins!&#8221; again he bellowed.</p>

<p>But Dumpkins only took an apple out of his
pocket and began to eat it.</p>

<p>He is a hasty-tempered young man that master,
and he strode toward the hapless Dumpkins and
shook him angrily, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer when I call, you cheeky
little beggar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, you never called me, sir,&#8221; expostulated
the boy, wriggling in the master&#8217;s grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve been shouting &#8216;Dumpkins&#8217; all over
the field for the last five minutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, please sir, my name is Jones!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Why did you tell me Jones&#8217;s name was Dumpkins,
you, Peter?&#8221; the master indignantly demanded
of Tod some minutes later.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done that, sir,&#8221; said Tod,
gravely, &#8220;for there&#8217;s nobody called Dumpkins in
the school.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this young master who rechristened the
twins when Peter next day insisted that &#8220;a point
has position but no gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strangely enough &#8220;The Merry Men&#8221; finds even
greater favor with them than &#8220;Treasure Island,&#8221;
and with the enigmatical decision of childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
their favorite of all the stories is &#8220;Markheim,&#8221;
not &#8220;Will o&#8217; the Mill,&#8221; beloved of critics. It is
doubtful if they understand much of it, but nevertheless
they read it over and over again to each
other aloud, or silently with their curly heads
pressed together, till they knew it by heart. To
be sure, &#8220;Thrawn Janet&#8221; has a dreadful fascination
for them, and they acted one of the principal
scenes with somewhat direful results.</p>

<p>Peter made Tod &#8220;tie him by the neck&#8221; to the
bed with red worsted, while Tod, in his character
of the minister, had to creep in, candle in hand, to
discover the dread spectacle; and Peter&#8217;s representation
of the fearsome Janet was so truthful
and blood-curdling that Tod dropped the candle
and fled downstairs howling at the top of his voice,
and such was his haste that he fell and sprained
his wrist. Meanwhile, the candle had set fire to
the valance of the bed, and altogether there was
a fine hullabaloo; there was also an end put to
their dramatic efforts for a week or two.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, however, about a month later,
on a Sunday evening when the servants were all at
church, and their mother writing for dear life the
long weekly letters that have to be written when a
woman has husband and four sons scattered about
the globe, Tod and Peter sought the seclusion of
the kitchen and determined to &#8220;act&#8221; &#8220;Markheim.&#8221;</p>

<p>All went well and quietly for a long time; the
firelit kitchen with loud ticking clock answered
admirably as the scene of the murder, the dialogue
between Markheim and the mysterious stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
went without a hitch, and Tod sallied forth into a
&#8220;wonderful clear night of stars,&#8221; while Peter shut
the back door softly after him. Peter, in his character
of Markheim, was bent upon making the
speech with which the story concludes, where the
maidservant rings the door-bell and Markheim
opens to her with the words: &#8220;You had better go
for the police; I have killed your master!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Tod had to be the maidservant&mdash;he always
had to follow where Peter led. He shivered as he
ran up the area steps; it was a cold night, he had
not troubled to provide himself with a coat, and
his heart was heavy, for, to tell the truth, he has
far more imagination than Peter, and sometimes
their plays are to him one long agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>He positively dreaded ringing that area bell,
and the sinister announcement that would follow
on the act. No longer was he Tod, but a trembling
servant lass who was forced by fate to ring a bell
which sounded a tocsin of dreadful import.</p>

<p>He ran down to the end of the terrace and stood
under a lamp that he might brace himself for the
final effort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Peter, swollen with importance at
the thought of the mighty sensation he would make
in a minute or two, stood squeezed against the
hinge of the door waiting for the fateful ring.</p>

<p>Then came a patter of light feet down the area
steps and someone gave the bell a modest pull.
Peter drew open the door with great suddenness
upon himself, exclaiming in a deep and tragic
voice, the result of long practice in solitary attics:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;<i>You had better go for the police; I have killed
your master!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitor gave a piercing shriek and rushed
up the steps again, calling breathlessly upon
Heaven and the police. Peter, behind the door,
wagged his head, exclaiming admiratively:</p>

<p>&#8220;How well that kid does act; I could almost
declare I heard skirts rustling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter waited awhile for his brother to return
and be congratulated, but Tod didn&#8217;t appear, so
he concluded that he had gone round to the front
door and come in that way; besides, the servants
were just due from church, and cook would be
cross if she found him in her domain. He ran
upstairs and waited for his twin in the drawing-room.
His mother looked up from her letters and
smiled at the little figure tip-toeing on the hearth-rug
to admire himself in the glass. Then scratch,
scratch went her pen again.</p>

<p>Now, Ada, the housemaid, has a dear friend in
service at the other end of the terrace, and she
attends a church where the sermons are shorter
than those at the one frequented by Peter&#8217;s household.
On this particular Sunday she got out of
church quite early and thought she would see
whether Ada happened to be in. Thus, while Tod
with lagging feet crept slowly down the terrace
from one end, she was already fleeing affrightedly
to the other in search of the nearest policeman.</p>

<p>She found him at the pillar-box, and fell into his
stalwart arms, crying hysterically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come quick! There&#8217;s bin murder done at
Number 9. Someone&#8217;s bin an&#8217; killed the marster!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>P.C. Lee turned the light of his bull&#8217;s-eye upon
Ada&#8217;s friend and found her fair to look upon. All
the same, although he still supported her trembling
frame, he shook his head slowly, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E ain&#8217;t there for to be murdered; the Colonel&#8217;s
bin in Hinjia this las&#8217; ten weeks; the missis
tol&#8217; me so &#8217;erself, when she ast me to keep a special
heye to them premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the same, in spite of his incredulity, P.C.
Lee was already on his way to Number 9, half
leading, half carrying Ada&#8217;s friend with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you,&#8221; persisted the girl, &#8220;when I
ring that there bell, the door opened sudden-like
as if someone was be&#8217;ind it, and a hawful voice
says to me, &#8216;You&#8217;d better go for the perlice,&#8217; it
says, &#8216;I&#8217;ve killed your master,&#8217; and I was that
taken to, I did go for you, Mr. Lee, as fast as I
could lay foot to the ground. It may be as one
of the young gentlemen&#8217;s bin murdered, &#8217;is pa
bein&#8217;, so to speak, abroad. It give me such a
turn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Ada&#8217;s friend was forced to stop in the
middle of the road, overcome by the horrid recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you see no one?&#8221; asked P.C. Lee,
in a judicial voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, trust me, I didn&#8217;t wait to <i>see</i> nothing; I&#8217;d
&#8217;eard enough without that. I&#8217;ll wait out &#8217;ere,&#8221; she
continued as they reached the scene of the tragedy,
&#8220;on the top of the steps. I couldn&#8217;t abear to see
no dead bodies;&#8221; and Ada&#8217;s friend disengaged
herself from the policeman&#8217;s protecting clasp and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
clung to the area railings for support, exclaiming
afresh: &#8220;I&#8217;d never get over it&mdash;never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must come in and give evidence wot
you did &#8217;ear,&#8221; expostulated P.C. Lee. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe myself as anything criminal &#8217;as occurred;
but I&#8217;ll just ring and ast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take my dyin&#8217; oath them was the very
words that murderer says to me,&#8221; cried Ada&#8217;s
friend, jibbing on the top step as the minion of the
law put forth a large hand to assist her down.
&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve killed your master,&#8217; says &#8217;e, despairin&#8217; like,
as if it was no use to try an&#8217; &#8217;ide it.&#8221;</p>

<p>P.C. Lee proceeded to perform a solo on the bell
very different to the two timid tintinnabulations
that had preceded it during the last ten minutes;
for while Ada&#8217;s friend sought the protection of the
strong arm of the law, poor little Tod had screwed
his courage to the sticking-point, gone back and
rung the area bell, when, to his unspeakable relief,
he was admitted by cook, just returned from
church in so benign a humor that she forebore to
scold him for being out at such untoward hours
&#8220;without so much as a &#8217;at,&#8221; and bestowed a piece
of bread and dripping upon him &#8220;to stop &#8217;is teeth
a-chatterin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon, comforted and refreshed, he departed
to find Peter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile P.C. Lee insisted that he must see
the missis, for Ada&#8217;s friend was unshaken in her
evidence, question they never so, and the four
maids at Number 9 declared that they could not
sleep comfortably in their beds unless the search-light
of his bull&#8217;s-eye was thrown on every dusky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
corner of the house by P.C. Lee himself before he
took his departure.</p>

<p>Ada&#8217;s friend was seated weeping in the front
hall surrounded by the others, when the mistress,
fetched by Ada herself, and accompanied by Tod
and Peter, descended to hold parley with P.C.
Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; concluded the
policeman, after a long explanation, continually
interrupted by Ada&#8217;s friend with such interpolations
as: &#8220;Oh, a hawful voice, that mournful&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Them
was the very words,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>During this recital Tod and Peter crept further
and further into the background, nudging each
other in the ecstasy occasioned by such an unexpected
tribute to their histrionic powers.</p>

<p>But their mother knows her Stevenson&mdash;and the
twins&mdash;so before the narrative was nearly finished
she turned swiftly upon them, demanding sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Which of you was it?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Young varmints!&#8221; said P.C. Lee to Ada&#8217;s
friend, as he escorted her home; &#8220;I might &#8217;a&#8217;
knowed it was them. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t the fust time I&#8217;ve
come across &#8217;em, neither....&#8221;</p>


<h4>II<br />

THE SENDING</h4>

<p>When the time came for those twins, Tod and
Peter, to go to public school, their mother seriously
considered the advisability of putting them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
into different &#8220;houses.&#8221; At first she thought that,
perhaps, it might make for righteousness to
separate them. But on hearing the subject mooted,
they so whole-heartedly fell in with her opinion,
rapturously reviewing the possibility of &#8220;changing
houses&#8221; whenever they felt so inclined, that
she instantly dismissed the idea; rightly coming
to the conclusion that if their extraordinary resemblance
was a cause of general muddle and
mystification while they were together, it would
become confusion worse confounded were they
separated. Moreover, she reflected that even
schoolmasters are men of like passions with ourselves,
and rightly refrained from adding to such
a one&#8217;s already heavy burden by a separate superintendence
of the twins.</p>

<p>Tod and Peter, whose mental attitude was always
that &#8220;all is for the best in the best possible
of worlds,&#8221; decided that after all propinquity has
its advantages, and rejoiced that family tradition
sent them into a house whose head was proverbially
the &#8220;slackest old slackster in the whole
school.&#8221; A dreamy, mild-mannered, gentlemanly
man that master, who left the management of the
&#8220;house&#8221; entirely to an extremely energetic wife
and a &#8220;young brusher&#8221; (&#8220;brusher&#8221; is the familiar
term for master in that school), whose prowess
in the playing-fields was only equalled by his extreme
fussiness where rules of his own making
were concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad chap,&#8221; the twins decided after their
first week; &#8220;but a bit like the German Emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
you know&mdash;wants things all his own way. Still, if
you humor the youth, he&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>So successfully did they humor the &#8220;young
brusher&#8221; in question that for the first month all
went smoothly, and the house-master himself, a
gentle optimist, ever ready to believe the best of
boy-humanity, really thought that the &#8220;character&#8221;
that had preceded them from preparatory school
was perhaps over-emphasized.</p>

<p>Their late headmaster, while giving them full
credit for general integrity and fair abilities, had,
in mercy to his brethren of the craft, pointed out
that they were ever &#8220;ready to join in frivolity and
insubordination, when not under my own eye.&#8221;
They had to work, for they were on the Modern
Side, and destined for the army, and in that particular
school, not the wiliest shirker in creation
can escape the argus eye of the &#8220;head of the
Modern,&#8221; or the retribution, swift, sharp, and
sure, that follows any such line of conduct.</p>

<p>But, bless you! ordinary work and games, at
which both were good, never found sufficient scope
for the energies of Tod and Peter, and by the time
the first month was up they began their tricks.</p>

<p>One Mr. Neatby, M.A., taught the twins chemistry.
Not that they went to him together. They
were in different, though, as far as work went,
parallel forms, and finding that their systematic
&#8220;changing&#8221; was never so much as suspected, and
therefore carried with it no spice of danger or
adventure, they gave it up, devoting their energies
to the tormenting of Mr. Neatby, who had by his
severity incurred their august displeasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Mr. Neatby was tall, severe, and dignified. He
really liked his subject, but felt, as a rule, little
affection for his pupils. Nevertheless, he was
conscientious to the last degree in the discharge
of his duties. His way of expressing himself was
what Peter called &#8220;essayish&#8221;; he gave lines lavishly,
and had but little mercy on the reckless
breaker of test-tubes. He did not rant, or stamp,
or call people by opprobrious names, as did many
better loved masters. He was always cold, cutting,
and superior. But the thing about him that
most excited Peter&#8217;s animosity was his necktie.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wears revolting, jerry-built, Judas-like
ties,&#8221; the indignant Peter proclaimed to an admiring
audience of lower boys; &#8220;ties that slip
down and show a beastly, brassy stud. His socks,
too, leave much to be desired; in fact, his extremities
altogether are such as betoken a bad, hard
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Tod softly, looking up from
a book he was reading; &#8220;do you think that a <i>sending</i>
might soften the man&#8217;s hard heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this particular stage of the twins&#8217; career, Mr.
Kipling was the God of their idolatry, and both of
them had &#8220;gloated,&#8221; even in the manner of the
immortal &#8220;Stalky&#8221; himself, over the vengeance of
Ram Das.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be managed,&#8221; Peter answered,
thoughtfully scratching his smooth chin; &#8220;but
then again, it may be close-time for kittens just
at present; don&#8217;t they generally bloom in the
spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always plenty of kittens, you juggins,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
ejaculated a prosaic friend. &#8220;Why, when I was
down at the riding school this morning, there was
a cat with six in an empty loose-box; they&#8217;ll have
to drown five of &#8217;em, they told me. D&#8217;your people
want one or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> want one,&#8221; Peter rejoined excitedly; &#8220;not
one, but five, to give to a dear friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d be your dear friend
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will. He&#8217;s an S.P.C.K., or whatever
it is. He&#8217;s awfully profane&mdash;humane, I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the other boy, still unconvinced;
&#8220;you can ask about &#8217;em when you go for your
lesson to-morrow morning. They weren&#8217;t half bad
little beasts, but I shouldn&#8217;t advise you to give
your friend more than one at a time, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Tod and Peter went twice a week to the
riding school in the town, as they were both destined
for cavalry. Every underling about the place
knew them well, and liked them. Their father had
lived in the town during his last leave, jobbed his
horses at the riding-master&#8217;s stables, and had himself
assisted at the lessons of elder brothers of
Tod and Peter.</p>

<p>Now there was at the school a certain Figgins,
a generally handy man, or rather boy, who worshipped
the ground the twins walked upon; and
after their next lesson they and Figgins might
have been seen holding long and earnest parley in
the loose-box containing the cat and kittens.</p>

<p>The twins laughed uproariously all the way
home, and just as they reached the house, Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
remarked: &#8220;I hate anything dead. Figgins has
promised not one of &#8217;em shall be drowned, and
when they&#8217;re fit to be moved, he&#8217;ll tell old White
he&#8217;s found good homes for the lot. And then&mdash;and
then Tod, my boy! our dear teacher shall have
&#8217;em alive, &#8216;alive, all alive oh! alive, all alive oh!&#8217;&#8221;
and Peter burst into song in the exuberance of
his joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby lived in lodgings within a convenient
distance of the school. He was therefore spared
any intercourse with the boys after school hours,
and usually spent his evenings in correcting innumerable
marble-boarded exercise books, containing
chemistry notes. He was so engaged one evening
about nine o&#8217;clock, when his landlady entered
the room and laid a square parcel at his
elbow.</p>

<p>He finished correcting the book he had in hand,
and took another, when his attention was arrested
by an indescribable sound.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby lifted his head and gazed about the
room. &#8220;Could it be a mouse under the skirting-board?&#8221;
he wondered. Then half unconsciously
his eyes fell on the parcel his landlady had brought
into the room. It was an oblong cardboard box,
about the size of an ordinary shoe-box. But, although
tied up with string, it was not wrapped in
paper, and on looking at it more closely, Mr.
Neatby discovered that the top was riddled with
small holes.</p>

<p>Had it been summer, he, being something of a
naturalist, would have at once concluded that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
someone had sent him some rare caterpillars, but
what caterpillars are to be found in November?</p>

<p>He drew the parcel toward him, and there arose
that curious sound again, louder and more insistent.
He hastily cut the string and removed the
lid of the box, and inside, reposing on a nest of
hay, lay a very young and mewey kitten. A kitten
who most evidently was homesick and aggrieved at
being reft from the maternal bosom. A sprawly,
squirmy, noisy kitten, that immediately proceeded
to climb out of the box and crawl uncertainly to
Mr. Neatby&#8217;s blotting-pad, where it collapsed into
a dismal little heap, mewing louder than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be some mistake,&#8221; muttered Mr.
Neatby, flushed and perturbed. &#8220;No one would
send <i>me</i> a kitten; that stupid woman must have
made some muddle or other,&#8221; and he arose hastily
and rang the bell.</p>

<p>He so rarely rang his bell after his modest supper
had been cleared away that Mrs. Vyner, his
landlady, had given up expecting him to do so,
and had on this occasion &#8220;just stepped out,&#8221; as
she would have put it, to see a neighbor.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby rang, and rang in vain, finally so far
departing from his decorously distant demeanor
as to go to the top of the kitchen stairs and shout.
But the faint mewing of the kitten was the only
answer to his outcries, and baffled and annoyed he
returned to his sitting-room to find that the kitten
had upset the red ink over Tod&#8217;s chemistry notes,
which, in company with many others, lay open on
the table, and was feebly attempting to lap it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little thing; it&#8217;s hungry,&#8221; he thought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
himself. And being, indeed, as Peter said, a very
humane man, he lifted it from the table, and went
to his sideboard to see if he could find any milk.
He did find some in the cupboard underneath
where it had no business to be, and pouring some
into a saucer, laid it on the floor beside the kitten,
who proceeded to refresh itself with commendable
promptitude.</p>

<p>Then, as his landlady still made no appearance,
Mr. Neatby bethought him of looking at the parcel
to see whether the kitten had been left at the
wrong house. But no; attached to the string was
a label, clearly addressed in a flowing, clerkly
hand, &#8220;S. S. Neatby, Esq., M.A.,&#8221; followed by his
address, accurate as to number, street, and even
town.</p>

<p>Once more he sat down in his chair, and leant
his head on his hand to think, when he perceived,
tucked into the hay at one side of the box, a card,
and drew it forth hastily; a plain glazed visiting
card on which was inscribed the words, &#8220;From a
grateful friend,&#8221; in the same excellent handwriting
as the label.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby blushed, and looked guiltily at the
happily supping kitten. In addition to being humane,
Mr. Neatby was also charitable, and there
were many poor who had reason to be grateful to
him. But as he always gave alms through a third
person, and was one of those modest people who
take care that their left hand knows not what the
right hand doeth, he felt quite upset.</p>

<p>Presently he heard his landlady and her niece
come in, and rang again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Who brought this box, Mrs. Vyner?&#8221; he asked,
holding it up toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say, sir, I&#8217;m sure. It was dark when I
answered the door, and a young man&mdash;leastways,
I think &#8217;e was young&mdash;simply give it into my &#8217;ands
and ran down the steps again. I &#8217;eld it under the
gas in the &#8217;all, sir, and read the label, as it was for
you right enough, so I brings it in and lays it
down without never interruptin&#8217; you, sir, like you
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>There was a kitten in that box</i>,&#8221; Mr. Neatby
said solemnly, in such a tone as might have announced
some national calamity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sakes alive! you don&#8217;t say so, sir,&#8221; cried Mrs.
Vyner in great excitement; &#8220;shall you keep it,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; Mr. Neatby said gravely;
&#8220;it must stay here for to-night anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty little thing, sir,&#8221; said the landlady,
stooping down to look at it where it lay basking
in the heat of the fire. &#8220;&#8217;Twould be company
for you, wouldn&#8217;t it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t it better go with you to the kitchen for
to-night, Mrs. Vyner?&#8221; Mr. Neatby asked persuasively,
and Mrs. Vyner, with many protestations
of wonder, gathered up the kitten into her apron
and departed to the lower regions, where she informed
the niece who lived with her that their
lodger &#8220;&#8217;adn&#8217;t spoken so many words to &#8217;er never
before, no, not in a month of Sundays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby threw the box into his capacious
waste-paper basket, but he put the card and label<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
carefully away in one of the pigeon-holes of his
desk.</p>

<p>Next day, on his return from morning school, he
found a white cardboard hat-box, big enough to
contain the most umbrageous matin&eacute;e hat ever
worn, set right in the middle of his table, and he
felt distinctly annoyed. His landlady followed
him into the sitting-room to lay lunch, and he,
pointing to the offending box, said coldly: &#8220;I
must ask you not to leave your parcels in my
room, Mrs. Vyner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vyner bridled, and seizing the box, held it
out toward him, remarking aggrievedly: &#8220;If so
be as you refers to this &#8217;ere, sir, I must ast you
to look &#8217;oo it&#8217;s addressed to. It&#8217;s put plain enough
for you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I assure you,&#8221; Mr. Neatby cried, recoiling
from the proffered hat-box, &#8220;that I haven&#8217;t ordered
a hat of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any&#8217;ow,&#8221; said Mrs. Vyner scornfully, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose, sir, as you&#8217;d order your &#8217;ats from
Madame Looeese, if you &#8217;ad. I thought per&#8217;aps
you&#8217;d bought a present for your young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Vyner,&#8221; replied Mr. Neatby, in a voice
glacial as liquid air itself, &#8220;you forget yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vyner set down the box with an angry
thump, and proceeded to lay the cloth in injured
silence.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Mr. Neatby approached the
mysterious package delicately, much as though it
had been an infernal machine of some sort, and
regarded it searchingly on all sides. It most certainly
emanated from the millinery establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of &#8220;Madame Louise,&#8221; but was none the less certainly
addressed in sprawly, feminine handwriting
to &#8220;S. S. Neatby, Esq., M.A.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Vyner opened the door, saying
waspishly, &#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s your kitting, sir; it keeps getting
under my feet while I&#8217;m dishin&#8217; up.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to have gained considerable vigor
during the night, for it rushed across the room
and up the curtain.</p>

<p>But Mr. Neatby had screwed his courage to the
sticking-place, and even the tempestuous entry of
the kitten could not turn him from his purpose.
Penknife in hand, he cut the string of the bonnet-box,
and lifted the lid timidly, prepared no doubt
for some tissue-paper protected &#8220;confection&#8221;
within. When, lo! even as that of the shoe-box
on the previous night was this interior; hay, dry
and fragrant of stable, met his astonished gaze,
while seated in its midst was a tabby kitten, who
gathered herself together for a spring the instant
the lid was lifted, and sprang with such good-will
as to turn the box over on its side, when she immediately
dashed under the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby gazed, as if hypnotized, at the
tumbled box, till the rattling of dishes outside
warned him of the near approach of his landlady
with lunch, and roused him from his trance.</p>

<p>He stooped hastily, thrust the scattered hay into
the band-box, clapped on the lid, and placed it
under the knee-hole of his writing-table.</p>

<p>The door was opened rather suddenly to admit
Mrs. Vyner; kitten number one descended from
the curtain, and Mr. Neatby found himself almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
praying that kitten number two would stay under
the table while his landlady was in the room. Mrs.
Vyner glanced disdainfully in the direction of the
band-box, noted that the string had been cut, set
the dishes on the table with somewhat unnecessary
violence, and departed without having opened her
lips, just as the two kittens frisked out from beneath
the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby, harrassed and flushed &#8220;all over his
eminent forehead,&#8221; did not begin his lunch. He
went back to the band-box again, studied the label
anew, and finally rummaged in the hay inside.</p>

<p>His search was rewarded by the discovery of a
rather dirty piece of paper, on which was written
&#8220;A Present from Framilode,&#8221; Framilode being a
village in the neighborhood, celebrated for the
manufacture of a certain kind of mug which always
bore that legend. He put it carefully beside
the other card and label in his desk, and returned
to his lunch with but small appetite, and a frown
of perplexity upon his brow. The kittens set up a
perfect chorus of mewing; Mr. Neatby braced
himself to explain the new arrival to Mrs. Vyner,
and rang for the pudding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my belief, sir,&#8221; said Mrs. Vyner that evening,
&#8220;that somebody&#8217;s a puttin&#8217; a &#8217;oaf upon you.
I sent my niece to that there Madame Looeese&#8217;s
with the box lid, an&#8217; she see madame &#8217;erself, and
<i>she</i> says as it&#8217;s a hold box, an&#8217; that they certainly
never sent you no box, nor wouldn&#8217;t think of such
a liberty, and you one of the school gentlemen and
all. But my niece, she said as madame did laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
when she &#8217;eard about the kitten, and &#8217;er young
ladies, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby writhed.</p>

<p>To a man of his reserved and sensitive temperament,
the reflection that his name could by any
possibility be bandied about by a milliner and her
assistants was little short of maddening. If he
could then and there have ordered Mrs. Vyner &#8220;to
take five hundred lines,&#8221; it might have given him
some relief. But in all things he was a just man,
and he knew that his landlady had at all events
meant kindly in trying to discover the perpetrator
of the outrage; for the fact remained that somebody
had most assuredly &#8220;put a &#8217;oax&#8221; on him in
the shape of the liveliest of tabby kittens.</p>

<p>It never occurred to him to suspect any of the
boys. For how could one of them come by either
band-box or kittens? To be sure there were some
day boys, but it happened that these were nearly
all &#8220;on the Classical,&#8221; and Mr. Neatby had but
little to do with them.</p>

<p>Of course he reckoned without the ubiquitous
Figgins, who, unlike Mr. Neatby, <i>had</i> a young lady,
who was employed by Madame Louise, and for
whom it was an easy matter both to procure a
disused band-box and a new label.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certain he got them all right?&#8221; whispered
Peter to Figgins at his next lesson, as that
worthy rushed forward officiously to settle the sack
on the horse&#8217;s back. &#8220;He gave me back my notes
simply smothered in red ink, and I thought I saw
a mark like a kitten&#8217;s paw, but I couldn&#8217;t be
sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Law bless you! yes, sir, <i>&#8217;e</i> got &#8217;em right
enough. I took &#8217;em myself, and wot&#8217;s more, both
of &#8217;em&#8217;s there still, for I passed by this mornin&#8217;
and &#8217;appened to look down the airey, and there
they both was as peart as print. I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;d
better wait a day or so for the next &#8217;un, &#8217;adn&#8217;t
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Figgins, wait two days till you see me
again,&#8221; and Peter dug his knees into his horse and
rode at the first jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather decent of him to <i>keep</i> them,&#8221;
thought Peter to himself, who was tender-hearted
where animals were concerned. &#8220;Perhaps, if he
doesn&#8217;t clap on any more lines for a bit, I&#8217;ll let
him off with two.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, alas for good intentions. When Peter got
back to the house, he found Tod bursting with
indignation. For at &#8220;Practical Chemistry,&#8221; that
very morning, Tod, who was supposed to be engaged
in the manufacture of hydrogen, used so
many conflicting ingredients as to cause an explosion
and dense smoke, and a smell so appalling that
it drove the whole class into the corridor, and
caused several testy masters to send indignant
messages demanding where the infernal smell
came from.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby, exasperated to the last degree, not
only told Tod to take five hundred lines, but bade
him return the very next half-holiday and spend
the afternoon in doing similar experiments under
his master&#8217;s supervision.</p>

<p>Tod confided his grievance to Peter at great
length, and concluded his recital with the injunction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
&#8220;Let him have all three, the <i>beast</i>! I wish
they were young gorillas.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Neatby was very busy. He was taking extra
duty for a master who was ill, and for three
or four days after the arrival of the second kitten
really had not a moment to call his own, so, as
Mrs. Vyner seemed to take quite kindly to the
new arrivals&mdash;only taking care to charge her lodger
an extra quart of milk daily for their maintenance&mdash;he
almost forgot their existence.</p>

<p>By Saturday evening he had accumulated a
mass of mid-term examination work to correct,
and directly after supper set himself down to it,
with four clear hours before him, for he often
worked till after midnight.</p>

<p>His lamp was trimmed, his fire burned brightly,
and one kitten, the first, sat purring on the hearth.
That, and the scratching of Mr. Neatby&#8217;s pen as
he corrected the generally mistaken views of boys
as to the nature of an element, were the only
sounds till there came a thunderous rap outside,
and the door-bell pealed loudly.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby frowned, but never looked up from
his corrections. He had not been long at the
school, and was not upon intimate terms with any
of the masters, so that it was hardly likely to be a
caller for him. He heard somebody open the front
door, then some vehicle drive away. A moment
later there was a knock at his door, and Jemima,
Mrs. Vyner&#8217;s niece, came in, bearing a hamper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, this &#8217;ave just come by rail; there
wasn&#8217;t nothing to pay.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Mr. Neatby answered without
looking up; &#8220;put it down, please; I can&#8217;t attend
to it just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jemima did as she was told, and once more
silence settled upon the room.</p>

<p>But not for long. Kitten number one got restless;
it walked round and round the hamper, and
sniffed and mewed, and mewed and sniffed, with
irritating persistency. Moreover, a curious muffled
echo seemed to accompany its mewing. Mr.
Neatby bore it for five minutes, then pushed back
his chair, caught the disturbing kitten by the
scruff of its neck, and bore it to the top of the
kitchen stairs, calling to Jemima to take it down.
That young lady obeyed his summons, taking the
kitten tenderly into her arms with many endearments;
but all the same she remarked to her aunt,
&#8220;Well, I do think as &#8217;e might manage to look after
<i>one</i> on &#8217;em &#8217;isself, that I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby went back to his papers and corrected
with more vigor than before; but, in spite
of his haste, in spite of his absorption, the muffled
mewing continued.</p>

<p>At last he laid down his pen and listened.
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;it can&#8217;t sound like that
from downstairs. I must have got the sound on
my nerves; it&#8217;s really most annoying.&#8221; It <i>was</i>
annoying; it grew louder and louder till it seemed
at his very side.</p>

<p>Mr. Neatby was endowed with great powers,
both of self-control and concentration. Having
decided that the sound was in his imagination, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
not actual, he went on with the paper that he was
correcting, but as he placed it on the top of the
growing pile he chanced to notice the hamper
which was placed on the hearth-rug close beside
him. &#8220;Apples, I suppose, from home,&#8221; he thought
to himself; &#8220;but all the same, I&#8217;d better see.&#8221; He
lifted it on to his knee. &#8220;Too light for apples,&#8221;
he thought again. &#8220;What can they have sent?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lid was not very tightly fastened, and a
slash or two of the penknife at the string restraining
it brought it away.</p>

<p>Hay, and again hay, in this case forming the
cosy nest of <i>two</i> kittens, one tortoiseshell and one
black. Both lively and vociferous beyond either
of their predecessors. Mr. Neatby ejaculated just
one word, and sat perfectly still with the open
hamper on his knee. The kittens climbed out and
made hay among his papers, but he took no notice.
&#8220;An angry man was he,&#8221; and when a man of his
temperament is angry, he usually sits tight. The
kittens got tired of the table, and jumped lightly
to the floor, carrying a few dozen papers with
them in their flight, but still Mr. Neatby sat on
staring into space.</p>

<p>When at last he roused himself, he once more
sought some solution of the mystery in the address
label, but the yellow railway label on the
back had been torn away, and only &#8220;ton&#8221; remained.
The address itself was printed very
neatly by hand.</p>

<p>Inside the hamper he found a little pink envelope
with nicked edges such as servants love. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
opened it, and printed by the same hand, on a piece
of paper to match, was the following verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The kitten&#8217;s a persistent beast,</div>
<div class="verse">It comes when you expect it least,</div>
<div class="verse">It comes in ones, it comes in twos&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">And when it comes it always mews.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mr. Neatby said softly to himself,
&#8220;some boy is at the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve, and he remembered
with a start that both his landlady and Jemima
would certainly be in bed.</p>

<p>What was to be done with the kittens?</p>

<p>He was far too kind-hearted to turn them out of
doors on a cold November night. They were really
uncommonly pretty little beasts, and as he watched
their gambles he found himself quoting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Alas! regardless of their doom,</div>
<div class="verse">The little victims play,</div>
</div></div>

<p>and then realized that they had no business to be
playing at all at that time of night, and that he
certainly wanted to go to bed.</p>

<p>He really was a much tried man that night.
First, he had to catch the kittens and put them in
the hamper, and as fast as he put one in, the other
jumped out. This took some time. Then he carried
the hamper up to bed with him, the kittens
making frantic efforts to escape the while. And
when at last he did get to bed, he had to get up
again to let them out of the hamper, for they
made such a frightful din no mortal could sleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
They finally elected to settle down on Mr. Neatby&#8217;s
bed, and in the morning one of them ungratefully
scratched his nose because he happened to move
when the kitten in question chose to walk over his
face.</p>

<p>When at last he arose from very broken slumbers,
the black kitten upset the shaving water and
scalded its foot, and made a dreadful uproar, and
the tortoiseshell, while investigating the mantelpiece,
upset and threw into the grate a blue vase
belonging to Mrs. Vyner.</p>

<p>In chapel on Sunday morning, Tod and Peter
noted gleefully the long scratch on &#8220;old Stinks&#8217;&#8221;
nose (&#8220;Stinks&#8221; being, I regret to say, the name
by which Mr. Neatby was known among his pupils).
And curiosity as to how he was getting on
with his rapidly increasing family of cats consumed
them. In the afternoon they walked up
and down the road outside his lodgings for nearly
an hour, but nothing did they discover; for Mrs.
Vyner&#8217;s windows were shrouded by white curtains,
no one went in or out of the house, and all
their loitering was not rewarded by so much as
hearing a distant mew.</p>

<p>The fact was that Mr. Neatby had gone for a
long walk to try and work off his irritation. That
morning, while he was still at breakfast, Mrs.
Vyner had appeared in his sitting-room, and somewhat
stormily informed him that her &#8220;&#8217;ouse was
not a &#8217;ome for lost cats, nor never &#8217;ad been.&#8221; And
she concluded her harangue as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve &#8217;ad gentlemen, masters at the school, for
twelve year come Michaelmas, and some &#8217;ave bin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
trouble enough, the Lard knows. With their football
and &#8217;ockey, and &#8217;ot baths in the middle of the
afternoon, and the mud on their flannings something
hawful; but a gentleman as surrounded &#8217;imself
with cats in sech numbers I never &#8217;ave &#8217;ad
nor never won&#8217;t again, I &#8217;opes and prays. And
although it do go again my conscience to do it of
a Sunday, I <i>must</i> ast you, sir, to take a week&#8217;s
notice from yesterday. For start a fresh week
with sech goin&#8217;s on, and cats a comin&#8217; by every
post as it were, I can&#8217;t; no, not if the king &#8217;imself
was to ast me on &#8217;is bended knees.&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain poor Mr. Neatby pointed out that, far
from &#8220;surrounding himself&#8221; with kittens, they
were thrust upon him he knew not by whom or
from whence. That he had no intention of keeping
any of them if Mrs. Vyner objected, and that
it would really be extremely inconvenient for him
to have to seek new rooms in the middle of the
term.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vyner was implacable. &#8220;I&#8217;m very upset
about it, too, sir,&#8221; she answered, more in sorrow
than in anger; &#8220;for I did think as &#8217;ow I&#8217;d got a
nice quiet gentleman, you not bein&#8217; given to them
&#8217;orrid games as is so dirty, nor wantin&#8217; an over
amount of cookin&#8217;. But a gentleman as &#8217;eaven
appears to rain cats on like it do on you is not
for the likes of me nor shan&#8217;t be. And though I&#8217;m
truly sorry as you should be so afflicted, I must ast
you to leave my &#8217;ouse, sir, next Saturday as ever
is, and that&#8217;s my last word.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t, not by a long way; for although Mr.
Neatby reasoned, nay, even almost implored Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Vyner to reconsider her decision, she would hardly
let him get a word in edgeways, and remained unshaken
in her desire that he should vacate her
rooms. &#8220;&#8217;Ow do I know, sir,&#8221; she asked again
and again, &#8220;wot hanimals may be sent you next?
My &#8217;eart would be in my mouth every time the
door-bell rang.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truly, Tod and Peter had planned a fearful
vengeance had they only known it. But they did
not know it, and their unsatisfied curiosity was
their undoing. On Monday morning at the riding
school they arranged with Figgins that he was to
leave the fifth kitten at Mr. Neatby&#8217;s rooms that
afternoon, just before afternoon school finished.
The despatch of the hamper had been managed by
a railway man, a friend of Figgins, whose cart
started from a parcel-receiving office close to the
riding school, and he delivered the hamper on his
evening round.</p>

<p>Directly school came out, the twins decided to
rush down to Mr. Neatby&#8217;s rooms before lock-up,
to ask some frivolous question about a paper he
had set, and perhaps by great good luck be present
at the unveiling of the end of the sending. All
fell out exactly as they had arranged. Figgins
took the parcel. Mrs. Vyner received it, addressed
as before to &#8220;S. S. Neatby, Esq., M.A.&#8221;
(his real name was &#8220;Stuart,&#8221; not &#8220;Stinks&#8221;), carried
it grimly into his sitting-room, and laid it on
the table. She removed all her own ornaments
from the chimneypiece and sideboard, and then
went downstairs and brought up all four kittens
(poor Mr. Neatby had not yet had time to arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
for their painless destruction), and shut them up
in the room to await their owner&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past five he hastened in, trod on
one of the kittens as he entered the room, and
struck a match to light his lamp. The kitten noisily
proclaimed its injury, and the other three expressed
their sympathy in similar terms. When
he caught sight of the brown-paper parcel on the
table he turned pale. The very feel of it was
enough, and even before he had torn off the cover
he was sure of its contents. Yes, in a common
little bird cage was a fat, white kitten, and an uncommonly
tight fit she was.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to let her out, though her
position was plainly one of extreme discomfort,
but stood with the cage in his hands, and the four
mewing kittens about his feet, in so universally
distrustful a frame of mind that he began to think
that Mrs. Vyner herself was in the plot to victimize
him.</p>

<p>The door was opened, and his landlady&#8217;s voice
announced: &#8220;Two young gentlemen to see you,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fresh colored and handsome, ruddy from their
run in the cold evening air, square-shouldered and
upstanding, Tod and Peter allowed their two pairs
of candid blue eyes to travel from their master&#8217;s
angry face to his hands, from his hands holding
the caged kitten to his feet, where congregated
the rest of the sending, and then exclaimed in a
chorus of genial astonishment: &#8220;Why, sir, what
a lot of kittens you keep!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, although he had been at the school three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
terms, no boy had ever ventured to call upon Mr.
Neatby before. Other masters might occasionally
ask boys to tea or permit an occasional call out
of school hours to arrange about house matches,
etc. But he had ever discouraged any familiarity
whatsoever, and that Tod and Peter should dare
to intrude upon him at such a moment seemed to
him, as indeed it was, a piece of unparalleled impertinence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want here?&#8221; he asked angrily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s after lock-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ord gave us leave to come,&#8221; Peter said
eagerly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand this question, sir.
Could you explain? What a noise those kittens
do make, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now if Tod could only have refrained from
looking at Peter, Mr. Neatby might have remained
forever in the dark as to the mystery of the kittens.
But, even as Peter spoke, Tod, unaware
that the light from the master&#8217;s lamp shone full
on his face, winked delightedly at his brother, and
in a flash Mr. Neatby connected their unexpected
and unnecessary visit with those equally unwelcome
visitants whose advent during the past week
had entailed so much annoyance upon him.</p>

<p>Taking no notice of the paper Peter held out
toward him, he laid the little cage on the table,
and said very quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you are here, you will perhaps kindly
explain what you mean by sending all these animals
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Us, sir!&#8221; the twins exclaimed breathlessly,
and as usual in chorus&mdash;&#8220;Us!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Did you or did you not cause these five kittens
to be sent to me?&#8221; Mr. Neatby asked again.</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>As Tod said afterward, &#8220;It was one of those
beastly yes or no questions that there&#8217;s no getting
out of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you or did you not?&#8221; Mr. Neatby asked
again, a little louder than before, though even the
kittens had ceased mewing and seemed to be listening.
&#8220;But I know you did, and I wish to know
further what you mean by a piece of such intolerable
impertinence, and such wanton defiance of
school rules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no rule about sending kittens, sir,&#8221;
murmured Peter, with the least suspicion of a
giggle in his voice.</p>

<p>That giggle broke down the last barrier of Mr.
Neatby&#8217;s self-control. For full five minutes he
permitted himself to thunder at those boys, finally
bidding them take all five kittens away with them
there and then.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t, sir; we <i>can&#8217;t</i> take them back to
the house,&#8221; pleaded Tod. &#8220;Whatever would Mrs.
Ord say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must take them away from here,
anyway, and what&#8217;s more, you must give up the
names of your confederates, that I may take proceedings
against them for their unwarrantable interference
with my privacy. Who were they, now?
At once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely impossible for us to do that,
sir,&#8221; Peter said firmly, and Tod might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
heard to murmur something about &#8220;can&#8217;t and
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Mr. Neatby, &#8220;you will both come
with me to the principal now at once.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principal of that school is one of the youngest
headmasters in England, and he would not be
the success he is did he not possess a sense of
humor. He partially pacified Mr. Neatby; he vigorously
&#8220;tanned&#8221; Tod and Peter there and then,
and during the remainder of the evening he
laughed to himself more than once.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the term Tod and Peter
found their comings and goings so perpetually
watched and suspected by the &#8220;young brusher&#8221;
aforesaid, that even the rapturous recollection of
the success of their sending was somewhat dimmed.
But it was not they who suffered most; to this day
Mr. Neatby suspects of sinister intention anyone
who so much as mentions kittens in his presence,
and new boys always wonder why their schoolfellows
are so anxious that they should mew in the
chemistry lectures. They only do it once.</p>


<h4>III<br />

THE BOY THAT DIDN&#8217;T COME</h4>

<p>During the first part of the next, the Easter,
term the twins were so closely watched that their
genius for mischief had small scope. Whereupon
the authorities, finding them apparently absorbed
in games and the general routine, relaxed their
vigilance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>At the beginning of February the weather was
mild and pleasant, with just enough rain to keep
the footer ground in good order. But at the end
of that fickle month there came a frost, the aggravating
sort of frost that makes a field too hard
for football and yet leads to no skating.</p>

<p>The never long dormant spirit of mischief in
the twins awoke.</p>

<p>As usual, it was Peter who began it, though Tod
was the innocent first cause.</p>

<p>Just after first lesson, as Tod was hurrying from
one classroom to another, he met the principal in
the corridor, who bade him ask his form-master
to come and speak to him at a quarter past ten.
Further down the corridor Tod met his twin, who
instantly demanded what the &#8220;Pot&#8221; wanted, and
on being informed, went upon his way.</p>

<p>Peter might have been seen to stop more than
one schoolfellow as he went&mdash;the corridor was full
of boys changing classrooms&mdash;and when he reached
his own he delivered a message to the effect that
the Head would like to see his form-master at ten-fifteen.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s form-master, familiarly known as &#8220;Pig-Face,&#8221;
from a fancied resemblance to that animal
in the matter of nose, is a testy man, much given to
abusing his form and to the use of opprobrious
epithets seriously reflecting upon the veracity of
boys in general; so, on receipt of the Head&#8217;s message,
he knuckled Peter&#8217;s head, called him a
&#8220;shuffling little beast,&#8221; set a complicated sum in
discount for his form to wrestle with during his
absence, and hurried away, fuming inwardly at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
unreason of such a summons in the middle of
morning school. When he arrived at the principal&#8217;s
room he found six other masters also in waiting,
but the principal himself was not there.</p>

<p>It happened that that gentleman had met Tod&#8217;s
form-master three minutes after he had seen Tod,
he said what he had to say there and then in the
corridor, and dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>The seven masters waited in a grumpy group
for ten good minutes, when, just as they had decided
upon immediate departure, the principal
himself rushed in and gazed in somewhat indignant
astonishment at the assembled multitude.</p>

<p>It took nearly five minutes more to explain the
situation, and the only boy whose conduct in delivering
the various messages seemed not wholly
inexplicable appeared to be Peter. For the principal
good-naturedly came to the conclusion that
it must have been Peter that he met, not Tod, and
that Peter had misunderstood him.</p>

<p>Such a charitable view of Peter&#8217;s conduct, however,
could not last long, seeing that six angry
masters rushed back to their respective forms to
inflict lines upon six perfectly innocent boys, who
were not slow to protest that the message was
entrusted to them by another.</p>

<p>During the morning three young gentlemen
from the Modern and four from the Classical received
a summons &#8220;to the principal at twelve,&#8221;
and of course Tod and Peter were of the number,
both looking so seraphically innocent that the
principal was perfectly sure that it was &#8220;a put-up
thing.&#8221; In this instance the innocent suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
with the guilty, for Tod got five hundred lines as
well as Peter. But they both agreed that to have
so scored off seven &#8220;brushers&#8221; at one time was
well worth the lines.</p>

<p>Three days afterward Tod&#8217;s nose bled toward
the end of morning school and he was dismissed to
his house to clean up. As he raced along the corridor
he noticed that the door of the little room
into which the rope of the school bell descended
was left open, and, peeping in, he discovered that
Hooper, the trusty porter, was not within.</p>

<p>In far less time than it takes to write the words,
Tod had rushed in, and the great school bell that
dismisses morning school rang loud and clear over
the peaceful playing-fields surrounding the school
buildings, still humming with the busy life within.</p>

<p>Every boy and every master stopped short in
what he was doing and looked at the clock. Those
possessed of watches consulted them, shook them,
listened to them, dubiously pressing them to unbelieving
ears. And as the clocks in that school
are by no means beyond reproach, being worked by
a system of electricity that is, to say the least of
it, capricious in its conduct, all came, not unwillingly,
to the conclusion that morning work had
indeed ended. Only the Head of the Modern, that
man of iron endurance, whose whole scheme of
creation seemed bounded by the exigencies of the
Civil Service Commissioners, refused to believe
that his watch was wrong, and continued to discuss
the &#8220;directrix and eccentric&#8221; of a certain
angle until it was really twelve o&#8217;clock; while one
of the French masters, hailing from Geneva, proclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the unreliability of English clocks in general.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hooper, who had gone down to the
lodge to speak to his wife, could hardly believe his
ears when his own sacred bell clanged, somewhat
irresponsibly and gaily it is true, without his
agency.</p>

<p>He rushed up the drive to discover the perpetrator
of this extraordinary outrage, only to meet
a throng of masters and boys streaming out into
the playground full twenty minutes before the appointed
hour.</p>

<p>Tod was nearly at his house by this time, and
when he did arrive, hastened to the matron to
descant upon the terrific hemorrhage that had occurred
in his nose.</p>

<p>But Nemesis was never very leaden-footed where
the twins were concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other chaps,&#8221; Tod remarked mournfully, &#8220;can
break all sorts of rules and do no end of mischief
and never get found out, but if we do the least little
thing someone&#8217;s certain to be down on us like a
hundred of bricks, or else we&#8217;re obliged to own up
to save somebody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this case it was the latter course that Tod had
to pursue. The principal was exceedingly angry
at such a wanton curtailment of the last hour of
morning school, and gave it out in the afternoon
that if the amateur bellringer did not disclose himself
that very day, the whole school should stay in
on the next half-holiday; and the frost had broken
and football was in full swing once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Of course Tod sought the principal at the earliest
opportunity and owned up.</p>

<p>When he appeared in the principal&#8217;s room after
afternoon school he made, it is true, a valiant effort
to present himself with due solemnity, but his
round face was absurdly chubby and cheerful, and
when the principal looked up from the letter he
was writing to see who the intruder was, he sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You again, Beaton!&#8221; he exclaimed wearily.
&#8220;So it was <i>you</i>, was it, who rang that bell? What
on earth did you do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My nose bled, sir....&#8221; Tod began eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What had your nose to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything, sir. I was sent out of class....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sent out of class?&#8221; the principal repeated
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I made such a mess,&#8221; Tod hastened
to add; &#8220;and the little door was open&mdash;and so I
rang the bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beaton, when will you cease to play these
senseless and annoying tricks? Your folly caused
six hundred boys, to say nothing of the masters,
to lose twenty precious minutes. If I punished
you as you deserve, you ought to stay in for twenty
minutes each day for six hundred days....&#8221;</p>

<p>Tod gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t do that. Instead, you must do a
thousand lines, to be given up by the end of this
week. I shall not cane you, as I have no doubt
you would infinitely prefer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good many boys assisted to write those lines,
and the impost was given up at its appointed time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Hockey leagues were on and Peter was playing
in his house team. On the morning of the last
practice before an important match, he acknowledged
so barely bowing an acquaintance with certain
French idioms beloved of the French master&mdash;for
was he not their author?&mdash;that Peter was
told to stay in after morning school and learn
them.</p>

<p>Peter did nothing of the kind; on the contrary,
he went out at the usual hour and played hockey
with his accustomed vigor, with the result that the
French master sent for him that afternoon to know
why he had not done as he was told.</p>

<p>Peter pleaded &#8220;a very important engagement,&#8221;
and, on being pressed to disclose the nature of that
same, as usual answered quite truthfully. The
French master, not unnaturally exasperated, forthwith
reported him to the Head of the Modern, with
the result that Peter was hauled up and bidden to
stay in on the next half-holiday; the very half-holiday
on which his house was to play its bitterest
rival.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that term he got into
several rows with his form-master, and Tod was
equally unlucky, so that by the time the Easter
holidays arrived both boys were quite ready for
them and left school vowing vengeance on their
persecutors.</p>

<p>Their parents were in India, so they went to
spend the holidays with a jolly young bachelor
uncle, who was an ardent fisherman and carried
both the boys off with him for three weeks&#8217; peel-fishing
in a remote village in North Wales. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
was also of a literary turn, that uncle, and took
with him a box of books to enliven their evenings:
lots of Kipling and Stevenson, and amongst the
latter the &#8220;Life and Letters.&#8221; He read aloud the
&#8220;Thomas Libby&#8221; incident, where Stevenson and
certain kindred spirits roused a whole neighborhood
to excitement by constant inquiries as to the
whereabouts of one &#8220;Thomas Libby,&#8221; who existed
only in his creator&#8217;s vivid imagination. That of
the twins was immediately fired by an ambition to
go and do likewise.</p>

<p>The incident, or rather series of incidents, to
which the non-appearance of Mr. Libby led up, enchanted
them. They chuckled over the mysterious
Thomas for a whole day, but it was not till evening,
at bedtime, that Tod whispered to Peter how,
like &#8220;Sentimental Tommy,&#8221; he had &#8220;found a
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sitting on the side of his bed, he announced gleefully:
&#8220;Tell you what it is, Peter, we&#8217;ll be a parent!
A parent with a delicate kid! And we&#8217;ll
write long-winded letters in scratchy, small handwriting,
you know, like the masters write....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Peter interrupted excitedly, &#8220;how are
we to get the answers? It wouldn&#8217;t be any fun if
we didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The answers,&#8221; Tod replied calmly, &#8220;will come
to the post office here, where we&#8217;re living, you
juggins! You bet there&#8217;ll be answers. They&#8217;re
awfully keen after the oof at the good old school.
Why, they scent a new boy a mile off. He shall go
into old Pig-Face&#8217;s house, just to pay him out for
all his beastliness to you, and I&#8217;ll pester the Head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
about him and his delicate chest, and all that sort
of rot that parents <i>do</i> write, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter gasped. &#8220;But how can he &#8216;go&#8217; into anybody&#8217;s
house if there isn&#8217;t a him to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an ass you are, Peter! <i>Was</i> there a
Thomas Libby? And how many people&#8217;s houses
was he going to, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Peter humbly, &#8220;go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The parent&#8217;s name,&#8221; Tod announced proudly,
&#8220;is Theopompus Buggins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theopompus!&#8221; Peter echoed dubiously. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t sound very real somehow&mdash;and is the kid
to be young Theopompus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tod firmly, &#8220;<i>his</i> name is Archibald,
and Mr. Buggins is his uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he was to be a parent,&#8221; Peter objected
in a dissatisfied voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, an uncle is a sort of parent; probably the
kid&#8217;s an orphan.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute while Peter digested
this view of the matter. But still he was
not quite satisfied, for presently he said: &#8220;Tod,
would <i>you</i> believe in anyone called &#8216;Theopompus
Buggins&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, I&#8217;m not sure that I would,&#8221; Tod
admitted. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you believe the Head will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Peter suggested beguilingly, &#8220;that
we had better have a commoner name, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps we had,&#8221; Tod sighed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have
Jones&mdash;Theopompus Jones, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jones is all right,&#8221; Peter allowed graciously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t fancy Theopompus much, it&#8217;s such a
peculiar name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a splendid name,&#8221; Tod exclaimed huffily,
&#8220;but of course if you think it&#8217;s too uncommon he
can be &#8216;T. Jones, Esq.,&#8217; or &#8216;John Jones&#8217; if you
insist upon it. How would you like &#8216;Peter
Jones&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;T. Jones will do spiffingly,&#8221; Peter answered
with some haste. &#8220;<i>We&#8217;ll</i> know his name is Theopompus
right enough, and it don&#8217;t matter a hang
to them whether he&#8217;s Theobald or Theophilus or
anything; but I say, Tod, must he be an uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tod replied firmly, &#8220;he jolly well must,
and, what&#8217;s more, he&#8217;s got to be going to Injia
just as term begins. We&#8217;ll look out the sailings
in uncle&#8217;s paper and choose his ship. He&#8217;ll just
get there in the hot weather, but that can&#8217;t be
helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The twins were well acquainted with the whereabouts
of &#8220;sailings&#8221; in the papers, as most Anglo-Indian
children are.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve planned it all, Tod,&#8221; Peter said
admiringly. &#8220;How&#8217;ll you do about the writing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write as like old Stinks as possible, that
niggly, scrabbly sort of writing, <i>you</i> know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! So you can&mdash;that&#8217;ll be all right.
Parents and people call that sort of writing
&#8216;scholarly,&#8217; but if we did it they&#8217;d say we were
beastly illiterate or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I like about a scholarly handwriting,&#8221;
said Tod thoughtfully, &#8220;is that no mortal can tell
whether the spelling&#8217;s right or not. When I&#8217;m
once through the Shop I shall always write a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
scholarly hand and not bother about spelling and
that any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; a voice called from the next room,
&#8220;you get to bed and don&#8217;t keep jawing all night.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would not be fair to disclose the exact spot in
Wales from which that anxious relative, Mr. T.
Jones, indited his first letter to the headmaster of
the Public School which reckoned Tod and Peter
among its pupils.</p>

<p>The Principal of Harchester School was at
breakfast in his hotel at the seaside when a letter
marked &#8220;urgent&#8221; and &#8220;if away please forward
immediately&#8221; reached him. He turned it over
thoughtfully before opening it, for he thought he
recognized the handwriting of one of his masters
(familiarly referred to by Tod and Peter as &#8220;old
Stinks&#8221;), a science master, much given to drawing
his attention to various details by means of lengthy
epistles.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world can Neatby want now?&#8221; he
wondered, &#8220;and in the holidays, too; it really is
a little too bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>On opening the letter, however, he found that it
was not from Mr. Neatby, and set himself forthwith
to decipher a missive in which the margins
were clear and spacious as the writing was small
and obscure. Yet it had the air, so the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
remarked to himself, of being the letter of an educated
man. Tod had played the &#8220;scholarly&#8221; game
with entire success.</p>

<p>The letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am desirous that my only nephew, Archibald
Jones, aged thirteen years and six months,
should be enrolled among the pupils of your famous
seminary at the commencement of the summer
session. But before placing him under your
benignant charge there are several points upon
which I am desirous of enlightenment. Certain
friends have recommended to me the house of one
Mr. Mannock, but from other sources I have gathered
that he is a man of somewhat violent temper,
sometimes almost abusive, in his intercourse with
the boys. Is this so? Because, if it is, I shall require
to seek some other house in which to place
my nephew, an orphan of extremely sensitive disposition,
with a weak chest. It is possible that the
accounts I have heard of Mr. Mannock&#8217;s violence
may be exaggerated, and I should like Archibald
to enter his house unless you especially warn me
against it. I wish my nephew to be entered upon
the Classical side, as I am given to understand
that boys are less overworked in that department
than in that where they prepare for the Army.
And as his delicate chest will prevent my nephew
joining in the rougher sports of his contemporaries,
I would suggest that one of the younger
masters should be told off to take Archibald for a
walk every fine day, as, of course, a certain amount
of fresh air and exercise is essential. He must
not be placed in too high a class, as owing to illness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
he has not been able to make such rapid progress
in his studies as his robuster contemporaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any information that you can afford me&mdash;and
as early an answer as possible, for I am leaving
England at the beginning of May and wish to see
my dear nephew comfortably settled before I sail&mdash;will
greatly oblige</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">T. Jones</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Tod had written &#8220;yours turly,&#8221; but was corrected
by Peter, who, if he had less sense of style,
was fairly dependable where spelling was concerned.</p>

<p>Now the postmistress, their landlady, found her
household duties so much increased by the presence
of her lodgers that she was fain to depute her
official cares to her daughter, Katie, a damsel who
greatly admired the good-looking twins. And
when they confided to her that if a letter came
addressed to &#8220;T. Jones, Esq.&#8221; it really was for
one of them, she asked no questions, required no
further information, but, concluding that it was
only a part of their mysterious charm to receive
letters in a name other than their own, promised
to guard the same should it come, without pointing
out to anybody that just then no person of the
name of Jones was residing at the post office.</p>

<p>The letter came in two days and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I enclose the entrance form to be filled up by
any parent or guardian desirous of placing a boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
at Harchester School. With regard to the house
in which you wish your nephew to board, Mr. Mannock&#8217;s
is, as I hope are all our houses, entirely
satisfactory. But if your nephew is, as you imply,
a delicate boy, I would suggest that he should
be placed in one of the smaller boarding-houses,
as he would then receive more individual attention
than it is possible to bestow in a house where there
are some fifty boys. I have asked the bursar to
send you a prospectus, in which you will find the
names and addresses of all the masters in the
school who take boys; and lest the house you select
should be already full, I advise you to communicate
with the master at your earliest convenience.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>When Mr. Theopompus Jones in the dual shape
of Tod and Peter received this missive they retired
to a distant bridge, whereon they sat to read it,
and they laughed so much that they nearly fell over
backward into the river. They gloated over the
very envelope. But later on, when their first glee
at getting an answer at all had somewhat abated,
they expressed disappointment that the Head had
omitted to answer so many of their questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Peter cried indignantly, &#8220;what a
shufflin&#8217; old hypocrite he is. You can&#8217;t get a
straight answer from him about old Pig-Face, and
he knows what an old brute he is just as well as
we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we send dear Archibald into one of the
smaller houses?&#8221; Tod asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Peter thundered. &#8220;He&#8217;s going to old
Pig-Face, and to no one else. Who knows but he
may save some decent chap from going there?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Let&#8217;s write again to the Pot, it&#8217;s such a lark, he
answers so nice and quick. Why, there&#8217;s over a
fortnight more of the holidays; we can get a whole
volume of his oily old letters by that time. I&#8217;ve
always wondered how humbugs like him manage
to grease up to one&#8217;s people so, and for the life
of me I can&#8217;t see why now.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night the twins again engaged in literary
labors, much to their uncle&#8217;s surprise, but he was
an ardent bridge player, and, having found three
like-minded anglers at the village inn, he was glad
to leave his lively nephews so peacefully employed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you chaps writing a story?&#8221; he asked that
evening as he departed to his bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; the twins answered simultaneously,
then Tod answered with some decision:
&#8220;No, Uncle Frank, we&#8217;re writing letters, business
letters, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; their uncle replied, much impressed,
and, having a peace-loving and incurious disposition,
he asked no further questions and was soon
contentedly playing a &#8220;no trumps&#8221; hand with conspicuous
success.</p>

<p>A day or two later the headmaster of Harchester
sighed gently as he found beside his plate at breakfast
another bulky epistle from the anxious-minded
Mr. T. Jones. This time that gentleman did not
content himself with generalities; he made the
most searching inquiries as to the disposition of
the aforesaid Mr. Mannock.</p>

<p>After thanking the headmaster of Harchester
for his &#8220;polite letter&#8221; (the headmaster raised his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
eyebrows as he reached this phrase), Mr. Jones
continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I fear that I cannot fall in with your suggestion
of a private boarding-house for my dear
nephew. In the first place it is too expensive, and
in the second place I wish him to go into Mr. Mannock&#8217;s
house if you can satisfy me that he is of the
considerate and forbearing disposition that a man
placed in his responsible position ought to be. I
am pressed for time, as I sail on May 1st for
Bombay, and an early answer will greatly oblige.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">T. Jones</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Tod and Peter had the very greatest fun in filling
in the form of application. They had long ago decided
that the youthful Archibald was to enter on
the Classical side, that he was destined for the
Church, that his father was &#8220;deceased,&#8221; but as to
the late gentleman&#8217;s profession they squabbled.
Peter wanted Army or Indian Civil; Tod was in
favor of Navy or Church; when Peter suddenly
recollected that there were &#8220;lists and things&#8221; in
most of the recognized professions and that an
&#8220;inquisitive old buffer like the Pot would be certain
to look him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally they decided that the deceased one had
better be a &#8220;merchant.&#8221; Peter wanted to add
&#8220;prince,&#8221; but Tod, the far-seeing, pointed out
that such affluence would hardly coincide with an
objection to one of the smaller boarding-houses
on the score of expense.</p>

<p>Finally they despatched their entrance form &#8220;to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the bursar,&#8221; elaborately filled up in the scholarly
handwriting of Mr. Theopompus Jones, the handwriting
that so puzzled the Principal of Harchester
by its haunting resemblance to that of one of his
masters.</p>

<p>Again the Pot was prompt and courteous, and
by return the twins were gloating over another
letter, which, however, again disappointed them
by its brevity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span> (it ran),</p>

<p>&#8220;As your time in this country is indeed getting
short, I would advise you at once to confer personally
with Mr. Mannock as to whether he can
find room for your nephew or not; for, in the event
of his having no vacancy, you still may be enabled
to place the boy in one of the other houses.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the shuffler!&#8221; Peter shouted indignantly.
&#8220;The quibbler! The sanctimonious humbug! <i>He</i>
thinks he&#8217;s diddled Theopompus Jones, does he?
He&#8217;ll find out his mistake before very long; it&#8217;ll be
Theopompus Jones has diddled <i>him</i>. I wouldn&#8217;t
trust that man with a bad halfpenny. He can&#8217;t
answer a straight question, that&#8217;s what he can&#8217;t do&mdash;and
yet to hear him talk....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; interrupted Tod, &#8220;suppose they send
in the bill, what&#8217;ll we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t propose we should pay it, do you,
you young ass?&#8221; Peter returned scornfully.
&#8220;They never send &#8217;em in till just before term,
sometimes not till after. Don&#8217;t you remember
how the pater grumbled last autumn because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
<i>didn&#8217;t</i> come, and he wanted everything settled up
before he sailed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So does Mr. Jones want it all settled before he
sails,&#8221; Tod remarked gaily. &#8220;He ought to write
to old Pig-Face to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>This the dual Mr. Jones did, and, as before,
received an answer by return of post from Mr.
Mannock, who, strange to say, had just one vacancy,
and expressed his willingness that Archibald
Jones should fill that same. And Mr. T. Jones,
refraining from further researches into the character
of Mr. Mannock, wrote with his own scholarly
hand, or rather hands, a letter which announced
the pending arrival of Archibald.</p>

<p>By this time the holidays were nearly over, and
the twins began to be somewhat anxious as to the
termination of Mr. Jones&#8217; correspondence with
the authorities at Harchester School. But their
good genius did not desert them at the last moment,
for just the day before they left Wales,
when they were at their wits&#8217; end for a satisfactory
ending to the episode, they came across the
&#8220;List of Members&#8221; of their uncle&#8217;s club; and,
idly turning over the leaves, Tod found that there
were no fewer than thirteen members of the same
surname as the anxious uncle of their creation and
three of them had &#8220;T&#8221; for their initial. Instantly
Tod&#8217;s resource was stimulated, and he despatched
three letters in the most scholarly of handwritings
to his headmaster, to Mr. Mannock, and to the
bursar respectively, announcing his immediate departure
for London and requesting that all future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
communications might be addressed to him at the
club in question.</p>

<p>In his letter to Mr. Mannock, he informed him
that Archibald would be sent one day earlier than
that given for the return of the other boys, as he,
Mr. Jones, would be so much occupied in arrangements
for his voyage that he would be unable to
give the boy the careful supervision his sensitive
disposition and delicate health demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t see their pompous old letters and
bills and things,&#8221; sighed Peter, &#8220;but it will liven
up the Jones fraternity at uncle&#8217;s club&mdash;it&#8217;s a good
thing he&#8217;s not going back to town just yet, or he
might hear something&mdash;and Pig-Face will simply
raise Cain when that precious Archibald mysteriously
disappears. We&#8217;re sure to hear about that,
anyway; two of his chaps are in my form, jolly
decent chaps they are, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you never <i>ask</i> anything about it,&#8221; said
Tod warningly. &#8220;They might suspect something,
and if we were ever found to have had any hand
in this we&#8217;d be sacked, sure as a gun. We&#8217;ve had
our fun and now we must jolly well keep it dark.
By the time it&#8217;s all finished I should say both the
Head and old Pig-Face will have done their thousand
lines apiece, shouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Curious thing that fellow never turning up,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; one of the &#8220;decent chaps&#8221; in Mr. Mannock&#8217;s
house remarked to Peter, some three days
after term had begun. &#8220;Pig-Face is in an awful
stew about it&mdash;afraid the boy&#8217;s been murdered or
something.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;What boy? What d&#8217;you mean?&#8221; Peter asked
innocently. &#8220;Who hasn&#8217;t come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one hasn&#8217;t come back; it&#8217;s a new chap
hasn&#8217;t turned up at all. Both he and his people
have mysteriously disappeared, vamoosed, vanished!
Awfully funny thing. There&#8217;s no end of
a fuss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps he changed his mind at the last minute,&#8221;
Peter suggested. &#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps he heard something
about old Pig-Face and funked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Old Pig-Face
looks awfully worried. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if we
had detectives down, and all sorts of games.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter looked thoughtful for a minute, and then,
to the astonishment of his friend, who was really
impressed by the enigma, doubled up with uncontrollable
laughter.</p>

<p>The assistance of Scotland Yard, however, was
not called in; for, on writing to the Bishop and
Admiral given as references by Mr. T. Jones
(boldly lifted, address and all, from &#8220;Who&#8217;s
Who,&#8221; by the ingenious Tod), the headmaster of
Harchester received an emphatic disclaimer from
each of these gentlemen of any knowledge of any
such person. Moreover, an inquiry at the post
office of the Welsh village from which Mr. Jones&#8217;
letters were dated only elicited the laconic response
of &#8220;Gone away&mdash;address not known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Katie had received and faithfully followed her
instructions.</p>

<p>Every Jones of the whole thirteen in that club
was approached in vain, and inquiry at the shipping
office only elicited the fact that, plentiful as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
persons bearing that patronymic appeared to be,
no passenger of that name had sailed by that particular
boat.</p>

<p>The authorities at Harchester came to the unwelcome
conclusion that they had been hoaxed;
and all that remained of the incident were certain
letters, treasured, on the one hand for purposes
of possible identification, on the other for more
frivolous reasons.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">&#8220;TONY&#8221;</h3>
</div>


<p>Tony sat in the gutter, wondering what would
be the coolest thing to do. The front doors of all
the houses in the dull, quite respectable street,
wherein he dwelt, were close shut, as were also the
white-curtained windows, lest dust should blow in
and sully these hall-marks of houses that possess
a front &#8220;best room.&#8221; The neighboring children
were all away; some at the recreation ground,
some to paddle their feet in the nearest approach
to a river the town boasted&mdash;a little muddy stream
about a foot deep at the best of times; now a sort
of pea soup.</p>

<p>But on this August afternoon Tony felt too slack
and too sticky to seek any amusement that necessitated
a walk; so, having been thrust out of the
back door by his mother, who was washing and
wanted no boys &#8220;clutterin&#8217; round&#8221;&mdash;he strolled
lanquidly to the front, quite sure that here, at any
rate, he would be left in peace, as the dwellers in
Eva Terrace never used their front doors except
on Sundays.</p>

<p>Just then a man carrying a bag came running
down the road, which was a short cut to the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, youngster!&#8221; he shouted, throwing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
bag to Tony. &#8220;Carry this for me, and I&#8217;ll just do
it! Run after me for all you&#8217;re worth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tony caught the bag dexterously and ran. He
could run faster than the man, and was soon jogging
on ahead of him. At the station Tony got
sixpence for his pains, thrust it deep into his right
trouser pocket, and walked soberly away.</p>

<p>Infinite possibilities were opened up by this unexpected
windfall, and he had no intention of mentioning
it at home. His people were poor, but not
poorer than their neighbors; his brothers and sisters
were all older than he, and in his case Benjamin&#8217;s
lot was not accompanied by the advantages
with which it is generally accredited.</p>

<p>A lonely child was Tony, gentle and biddable
enough, quick at his books, and happiest in his
school hours, when people let him alone, and he
succeeded in pleasing the clever, testy schoolmaster,
whose life was embittered by a constant
struggle with an overwhelming desire to whack
the young demons who tormented him. He had
been &#8220;summonsed&#8221; twice by irate parents; so now
he restrained himself at the expense of his teaching
powers and his nerves generally.</p>

<p>Tony stopped in the middle of the road and
smacked his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the baths to-morrow morning,&#8221; he
said aloud, &#8220;and see them young nobs swim; it&#8217;s
only threepence before nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great excitement&mdash;unshared, unmentioned&mdash;had
lately come into Tony&#8217;s life. Every morning
for the last week, about eight o&#8217;clock he had
watched for two boys who went by on bicycles with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
towels strapped on to their handle-bars. One was
quite a little boy, far less than Tony himself; the
other bigger, and in his eyes less interesting; and
in a few minutes after them came one for whom
Tony had conceived the extravagant, unreasoning
admiration children will sometimes lavish on somebody
with whom they have never exchanged, or
hope to exchange, two words; someone unconscious
of their existence as they are the richer for that
other&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Everybody in Tony&#8217;s locality knew the recruiting
sergeant by sight: &#8220;Sergeant&#8221; who taught
drill and gymnastics to all the &#8220;young gen&#8217;lemen&#8221;
in the neighborhood. But Tony adored him, not
only because he was so tall and good looking&mdash;and
Tony was strenuously certain that it is a
goodly thing to be upstanding and to have broad
shoulders, instead of the champagne-bottle variety
carried by his brothers and their like&mdash;but because
he knew that the sergeant wished him well; inasmuch
as that he, even he also, was one of the hundred
and fifty odd boys in the parish schools of
St. James&#8217;s. For now that the war fever was
somewhat abating, now that Sergeant himself had
come back from the front that he might send more
soldiers out there, he had offered to drill the boys
in St. James&#8217;s schools twice a week for love. And
it could not be arranged.</p>

<p>The authorities, while granting the utility of
algebra and French to those in the seventh standard,
who were presently to form the bulk and bulwark
of the nation, saw no good reason why an
attempt should be made to give them straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
backs and broad chests. So Sergeant, who loved
his country, and was, in his way, something of a
philanthropist, sighed and swore, and &#8220;put the
question by.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tony, who had heard the subject canvassed,
and listened to the lamentations of the boys, was
filled with a passion of gratitude, which found no
expression save in a constant hanging round corners
to see his idol pass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tony sat on his bed naked, in a patch of moonlight,
admiring his own legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;My body be whiter nor theirn,&#8221; he said to himself,
and indeed, his limbs looked radiantly fair
in the mellow light. &#8220;But my arms beant so &#8217;ard
as &#8217;is&#8217;n for all &#8217;e be such little chap,&#8221; he continued,
pinching the soft flesh of the upper arm in a dissatisfied
way.</p>

<p>Tony was too excited to sleep just yet&mdash;such a
great deal had happened in the last two days. In
all his ten years he had never felt as he felt now&mdash;and
yet, from an outsider&#8217;s point of view, what a
little thing it was!</p>

<p>The day before he had gone to the swimming
bath, intending just to watch. It was empty, save
for Sergeant and the two boys who went with him
every morning. The water looked so clear, and
there seemed so much room in the big bath, that
Tony undressed and went in.</p>

<p>He paddled shyly about in the shallow end, admiring
the two boys, who dived off the spring-board
and the pulpit and swam under water, while
Sergeant roared directions at them, and flung them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
head over heels in the deep end, in a fashion that
filled Tony with surprise.</p>

<p>The big boy was practising side-stroke, when the
little one, whom Sergeant, for some reason or
other, called the &#8220;swashbuckler,&#8221; swam down the
bath toward Tony, remarking cheerfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get rheumatism if you paddle so. Shall
I show you the first exercise?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was such a little boy, but he swam like a
frog. His square, freckled face was so friendly
that Tony forgot that he himself was an &#8220;oik,&#8221;
and therefore his sworn foe, and said, &#8220;Please,
sir!&#8221; in the meekest of tiny whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must kneel on the edge further down, and
let me chuck you in,&#8221; was the next command&mdash;and
Sergeant stopped in the very middle of a shout
to chuckle and whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Blest if the swashbuckler isn&#8217;t giving a swimming
lesson on his own account!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Tony sat on the edge of his bed and
remembered two wonderful mornings, and pondered
what it could be that made that friendly
little boy so different from all the other boys he
knew. And through all his thinking, like the refrain
of a song, sounded a sentence he had once
heard at Sunday school. He could not remember
the whole of it; but five words seemed to batter
at his brain as though demanding instant comprehension
and attention&mdash;&#8220;<i>The temple of your
body.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Tony nodded as though in answer to a spoken
word. He pictured Sergeant cleaving the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
with his long arms, the muscles standing out on
his white shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; said Tony softly, as if in answer
to that unseen, persistent voice, &#8220;some folks &#8217;as
temples for bodies, and some folks &#8217;as on&#8217;y tin
churches, or, so to speak, a public.... I&#8217;d like
a temple myself for ch&#8217;ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not very sure what a temple was, but in
a vague way he <i>was</i> assured that it was something
large and beautiful; and his conception was helped
out by hazy recollections of Sunday school and
Solomon, and thoughts of a building spacious and
white.</p>

<p>&#8220;There used to be a free night,&#8221; he continued,
reverting again to the actual, &#8220;but the Corpeeration
stopped it&mdash;I wonder w&#8217;y? It&#8217;s tuppence
after six, that&#8217;s a shillin&#8217; a week&mdash;&#8217;ow can pore
boys get that?&mdash;an&#8217; I promised &#8217;im as I&#8217;d learn
the others w&#8217;en I could get a chanst, when he&#8217;s
learned me....&#8221;</p>

<p>Tony&#8217;s voice faltered, he was getting sleepy.
He gave his smooth white arms another stroke,
slipped into his nightshirt, and got into bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;E&#8217;ve give oi a shillin&#8217; to pay for four more
mornin&#8217;s, till &#8217;e do go away,&#8221; he whispered ecstatically
as he laid his head on the pillow, and
Tony fell asleep.</p>

<p>That evening Tony&#8217;s elder brother &#8220;Earny,&#8221;
who cleaned bicycles, and was &#8217;prenticed to a
dealer in the neighborhood, wanted his Sunday
necktie, for he purposed to &#8220;walk out with his
young lady.&#8221; He ran upstairs to the room he
shared with Tony and another brother, to find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
little boy fast asleep, worn out by unusual exercise
and varied emotions.</p>

<p>Earny could not find his tie, and on lifting
Tony&#8217;s trousers to see if by any chance it was
hidden beneath them, a shilling rolled out of the
pocket and finished spinning with a clang, just in
the very centre of the patch of moonlight where
a quarter of an hour earlier Tony had decided
that he, at all events, &#8220;would &#8217;ave a temple for
ch&#8217;ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ullo!&#8221; thought Earny to himself, &#8220;where did
that kid collar a bob? &#8217;E bin a&#8217;ter no good, I&#8217;ll be
boun&#8217;, so secret-like and sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; to nobody.
Serve &#8217;im right if I buys some smokes with &#8217;un;&#8221;
and Earny departed quietly, without having fulfilled
his original intention of waking Tony that
he might look for the missing necktie.</p>

<p>At nine o&#8217;clock the following morning Tony
still lay upon his bed, wide-eyed, white-cheeked,
with blank despair writ large upon his face.
Breakfast was over long ago, his family had all
departed to their daily work; his mother was
ironing in the kitchen, he could hear the bump of
the iron as she slammed it on the table; the bedroom
could wait till one of the girls came in at
dinner-time, so no one interfered with Tony.</p>

<p>He knew that it was his brother who must have
taken the shilling&mdash;the precious shilling that had
meant so much to him. He knew that he had no
redress, no one would believe him if he told them
how he came by it, and in his utter misery he was
too poor-spirited even to think of reprisals. His
whole imagination centred round the dreadful certainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
that Sergeant and the little gen&#8217;leman and
the little gen&#8217;leman&#8217;s brother would think him a
fraud. For a brief space the sun had shone out
on his drab life, discovering hitherto undreamt-of
colors in the landscape, but now....</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never watch for &#8217;em no more,&#8221; he said,
with a hard, tearless sob.</p>

<p>Presently he stood out on the floor and shook his
nightshirt about his feet; he dressed quickly, and
did not even wash his face as he was wont to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use for the likes of me to try,&#8221; he
said bitterly.</p>

<p>Then he went to his brother&#8217;s drawer and stole
the bundle of cigarettes he found there, and went
out and smoked under the railway bridge till his
body was as sick as his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him plainly beforehand that if he did not
get a scholarship this term he must go into business.
He has not won a scholarship, and, situated
as you are, any other course would be absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Henry shut his mouth with a snap, while
he stared fixedly over his sister&#8217;s head that he
might not see the pleading in her eyes as she said
timidly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But fourteen is so young, Henry, and Rodney
is so small for his age&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fail to see that his size has anything to do
with it; and you, Felicia, must learn to face things
as they are, not as you would have them. If you
defer for one moment the chance of Rodney&#8217;s
making his own living, you are doing an injustice
both to him and to his sisters. Pardon my plain
speaking, but he is the son of an exceedingly poor
widow and must be dealt with accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the open windows came the sound of a
boy&#8217;s laughter and the ring of a smartly struck
cricket ball. Uncle Henry waved his hand in the
direction of the sound, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you see; that&#8217;s what his education at
present amounts to; he&#8217;s a pretty bat, and doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
looks forward to a life all flannels and cider-cup
and yells of admiration when he makes a few
runs; the sooner all that nonsense is knocked out
of him the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Rodney is not idle, Henry,&#8221; his mother
pleaded; &#8220;his form-master and the Head both
speak well of him and say that he has a very good
chance next year, although he has missed this; you
know the exam. came on just after his father&#8217;s
death, when the boy was dreadfully upset.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made you an offer, you may take it or
leave it. You can put him into one of my businesses;
there will be no premium, and I&#8217;ll pay for
his board at a thoroughly good boarding-house I
know of in Mecklenburg Square, where he will be
well looked after. In the meantime you must try
to let this house, and then you can come up and
live in the suburbs, and he can live with you and
go to business every day by train; the little girls
can go to a High School. With the many claims I
have upon me, this is all that I can do, and I must
serve you in the way that seems best to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Henry sat down and took up the newspaper
in token that the subject was thoroughly
threshed out. He had gone into business at fourteen,
and now at little past thirty had a house in
Grosvenor Gardens and a &#8220;place down the river.&#8221;
He had married at six-and-twenty, &#8220;going where
money was.&#8221; The names of his two sons were
down for Harrow, while his wife already talked of
the time when she should &#8220;present&#8221; their baby
girl. He quite acknowledged that it was his duty
to help his sister now that the collapse of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Australian banks had practically beggared her;
but there was at the back of his mind a lurking
satisfaction that the way he had chosen should be
one calculated to destroy those castles of tradition
her husband had been so fond of building. It
was a perpetual annoyance both to his wife and to
himself that Rodney and his sisters should be so
very different in appearance from their own children;
that, clean or dirty, these children without
a sixpence should so strongly resemble the old
family portraits that his brother-in-law&#8217;s ridiculous
will forbade to be sold; that they should in
speech and bearing so unmistakably be gentlefolk,
and yet be his own sister&#8217;s children seemed
to him a proof of nature&#8217;s ineptitude.</p>

<p>To be sure he and Felcourt had been on friendly
enough terms, but he had always&mdash;though through
no fault of Felcourt&#8217;s&mdash;been conscious that his
brother-in-law and his ancestors for generations
belonged to a class which only of late, and that not
altogether with enthusiasm, has opened its doors
to successful men of Uncle Henry&#8217;s stamp.</p>

<p>Rodney&#8217;s mother went and stood by the open
window. The active white figures flying between
the wickets on the wide lawn seemed all blurred
and indistinct, and she lifted her slim hand to her
throat to still its throbbing ache; she was not a
strong-minded woman. All she had asked of life
was the power to make folks happy, and to be
loved; and hitherto her desire had been generously
fulfilled. Married at eighteen to a man who,
taking her out of somewhat sordid and uncongenial
surroundings, made her queen of a household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
where gaiety and good manners had been
vassals for generations, she readily adapted herself
to the new atmosphere, and became a sweet-voiced
echo of her husband, and for fourteen years
was absurdly happy. Then Rodney Felcourt died,
and six months afterward came the collapse of the
Australian banks.</p>

<p>Uncle Henry had a way of carrying through any
course of action he had determined upon, and by
the beginning of October his nephew Rodney found
himself taking his exercise in the Gray&#8217;s Inn
Road instead of in the playing-fields at school.
The change of life was so radical and so sudden
that the child hardly understood what had happened.
Like the old woman in the nursery rhyme,
he was forever exclaiming, &#8220;This be never I!&#8221; in
melancholy astonishment. He was learning to tie
up parcels, he stuck on endless quantities of postage
stamps, and occasionally addressed a few envelopes
for one of the typists. He did what he
was told as well as he could, the day seemed endlessly
long, and by evening he was so tired that
he went to bed soon after the seven-o&#8217;clock dinner.
A young boy for his age, he was quite unprecocious
and unformed; hitherto his place in the
universe had been clearly defined and not difficult
to fill; to do well in his form, thus pleasing the
&#8220;mater&#8221; and his form-master, to be &#8220;decent&#8221; to
his little sisters at home, and &#8220;jolly&#8221; with the
chaps at school, to be good at games and get
into the &#8220;house&#8221; eleven, and to be absolutely
&#8220;straight&#8221; in word, deed, and across country&mdash;such
was Rodney&#8217;s conception of the whole duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of boy, and he had acted up to it with considerable
success. Now, life was not only complicated
but unintelligible, and he was too bewildered even
to rebel against a fate that kept him tying up parcels
indifferently well when he felt that by all the
ordinary standards of conduct he ought to have
been writing Latin verses.</p>

<p>Every Sunday he wrote neat, stilted little letters
to his mother, which informed her that he had
been to church at the Foundling, was going for a
walk in the afternoon, that he was well and hoped
that she was well, and that he was her very loving
son. Felicia crushed the paper against her cheek
in the vain attempt to extract from it something
real and Rodney-like. She thought of the school
letters last term, how full of life they had been,
how numerous the requests they contained! Rodney
never asked for anything now, and she knew
that the boy was holding himself well in hand lest
any part of the truth might hurt her.</p>

<p>At the end of October, Cecil Connop came back
from Paris. His arrival was announced in all the
papers, for he was of some importance in literary
circles; his great ability was acknowledged on all
sides, the more freely that he was something of a
failure. Though his work was widely read and
appreciated by cultivated people, he was not popular.
His appearance was quite ordinary, and he
made no attempt to resemble any historical personage.
He abhorred advertisement, considering
that his published writings had no sort of connection
with his private life. His readers were
quite ignorant as to whether he had a mother or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
not, and his personal friends suffered under no
apprehension that their loves or their bereavements
would figure, flimsily disguised, in his next
book. His rooms in Jermyn Street had never been
photographed, and only his servant knew whether
he liked his bath hot or cold. The fact was that
Cecil Connop kept one face for the world and
quite another for the old friends who loved him&mdash;a
proceeding so out of date among literary people
as to be almost medieval. But it has its advantages
for such as like curtains to their windows.
According to his own account he never had any
money, and was, when in England, in hourly danger
of Holloway Jail; but he paid his card debts
and never seemed to lack any of the things that
go toward making life pleasant.</p>

<p>Felicia&#8217;s letter announcing little Rodney&#8217;s apprenticeship
was a great surprise to Cecil. He
had, of course, heard of her serious losses, but he
knew that her brother was a wealthy man and
&#8220;people always manage somehow&#8221;; that in this
case they hadn&#8217;t &#8220;managed&#8221; came upon him with
quite an unpleasant shock.</p>

<p>For some reason which she would not define
even to herself, Felicia had not asked any of her
friends then in town to look up Rodney. She was
absolutely certain in her own mind that he had
no business there, but circumstances were too
strong for her, and she dared not offend Henry.
When she read in the paper that Cecil had returned
to town she felt distinctly relieved. Here was an
understanding person who would ask no questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and could be depended upon to give a faithful account
of the child.</p>

<p>Cecil wrote at once to Rodney asking him to
lunch at his club on the following Saturday, and
to Felicia, to say how pleased he would be to do
what he could for him while he was in town.</p>

<p>Rodney sat on the edge of his bed, too tired to
undress. His flannels and &#8220;sweater&#8221; were spread
on the pillow, and from time to time the boy laid
his face down on them, inhaling the clean, woolly
smell. He had of course never worn them since
he came to London&mdash;Uncle Henry had not thought
it necessary to make any arrangement as to how
Rodney should spend his Saturdays&mdash;yet the sight
of them comforted him. He was beginning to
employ that saddest of all philosophies, that nothing
can take from us the good times we have had.
He had eaten hardly anything all day, and the
ache in his throat was well nigh intolerable. His
door opened, and the maid announced: &#8220;A gentleman
to see you, sir. Said he&#8217;d come up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecil had come before his letter. As the open
door betrayed the listless little figure with the
scattered flannels the whole situation was revealed
to him in a flash, and for the hundredth
time in a not over well-spent life he cursed the
folly which had rendered him so incapable of helping
his friends in any material way. When Rodney
realized who was his visitor, he simply flung
himself bodily upon him, and Cecil Connop, who
was tender-hearted and easily touched, kissed him
and had been rapturously kissed in return before
he had time to consider whether the boy would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
offended or not. Then they both sat on the bed
and for the first time for six weeks Rodney chattered.
One of the boarders, a girl who did typewriting
in Chancery Lane, passing his doorway,
stopped and smiled as she heard the ripple of
Rodney&#8217;s laughter; she waited for a full minute,
enjoying the unwonted sound, then passed on to
her own room unaccountably cheered. People in
that house were too busy and too tired to laugh!</p>

<p>When Cecil Connop got back to his rooms he
sat and smoked for a long time before he wrote
the following letter to Felicia Felcourt:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;To-night I have spent an hour with Rodney,
and find him apparently well and cheerful. I cannot
faithfully report upon his appearance, as it
was candle-light and I did not see him very distinctly.
He talked freely enough about you all at
home, about his old school, about myself; but,
when I come to think of it, said nothing about his
business. You will, I know, pardon me if I ask
you in all seriousness&mdash;is this necessary? The
whole time I was with him I had a curious sense
that he was playing truant and ought to be at
school; and there is one thing that an expression
in your letter impels me to say at the risk of being
impertinent: no amount of money in the world is
such a possession as the breeding you and his
dead father have given your boy. Forgive this
frankness and believe me that I feel with you the
more keenly that I am so conscious of my own
gross impotence to help.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>On Saturdays Rodney left business at one, and
on this particular Saturday flew back to &#8220;Meck&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
to change into his &#8220;Etons,&#8221; when he hied him on
the top of an omnibus to lunch with Cecil Connop
at his club. When he was seated opposite to his
host, that gentleman proceeded to examine him
critically. The boy was unmistakably a gentleman:
everything about him, from the long slender
hands of which he was so unconscious, to the
way he looked his companion straight in the eyes,
proclaimed him to come of a race who had spent
their days otherwise than in tying up parcels.
Men passing in and out looked pleasantly at the
pretty boy who was so plainly enjoying the unwonted
experience; but Cecil noted that he was
very thin, that after the first flush of greeting was
past the little high-bred face was pale, and that
there were black shadows under the long-lashed
grey eyes. Moreover, although there was everything
for lunch calculated to please a boy, he ate
hardly anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they decent to you at your place of business?&#8221;
asked Cecil, carefully pouring cognac into
his coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Rodney slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem
to know anybody....&#8221; Then, with a twinkle of
amusement, &#8220;They call me a fool when I make
mistakes, which is pretty often, and if I do things
right nobody says anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next week or two Cecil made a point
of seeing Rodney from time to time, and after each
meeting he felt more and more convinced that the
boy&#8217;s health was failing. He did not complain,
but the sedentary life was beginning to tell upon
a constitution that had never been so tried. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
began to stoop, and even with Cecil his laugh was
by no means so ready or so frequent as it had
been.</p>

<p>Felicia, although at first much comforted by
Cecil&#8217;s account of Rodney, longed after him as
only widowed woman can long for her son; but
she had promised her brother that she would not
attempt to see the boy for three months lest it
should unsettle him, and it only wanted three
weeks of the stipulated time.</p>

<p>Rodney had not seen Cecil for a fortnight; he
was out of town, but this Rodney did not know.
It was Saturday, and a smell of onion curry pervaded
the boarding-house, the Square garden
looked hopelessly uninviting, and he felt that he
could endure neither the one nor the other a moment
longer. So he hied him to Pall Mall to see
if he could catch a glimpse of his friend. A conspicuously
forlorn little figure, he strolled slowly
past the many clubs, when a man coming hastily
down some steps stared hard at Rodney, and, fixing
his eyeglasses more firmly on his nose, turned
and walked swiftly after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Felcourt! Felcourt! What are you doing
here?&#8221; asked a sharp, nervous voice, and Rodney
started violently as his house-master, &#8220;Fireworks
Fenton,&#8221; caught him by the shoulder and
shook him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;You young ass! Why didn&#8217;t you write and
tell me all about it?&#8221; said &#8220;Fireworks Fenton&#8221;
an hour later, as he angrily thumped a tea-table in
&#8220;Stewart&#8217;s&#8221; till the cups jumped off their saucers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
&#8220;We all thought you&#8217;d gone to another
school, and here have you missed a whole term,
and lost flesh and muscle, and forgotten everything
you ever knew. I&#8217;ve no patience with you;
it&#8217;s preposterous, and must be put an end to at
once! Give me your uncle&#8217;s address and your
mother&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and &#8220;Fireworks&#8221; glared at Rodney
through his eyeglasses, and Rodney sat swallowing
uncomfortable things in his throat, while
his heart felt lighter than it had been for many
a long week. It was so good to be bullied in that
particular fashion once more. Now he dared to
look forward. He didn&#8217;t in the least know how it
was to be managed, but his old master had told
him he was to come back to school next term, and
<i>he</i> always got his own way even with the Head
himself. &#8220;Fireworks&#8221; was not afraid of twenty
Uncle Henries&mdash;&#8220;Worthy but mistaken, worthy
but mistaken,&#8221; he had muttered more than once
during his late pupil&#8217;s explanations. Rodney
went with him to Paddington to see him off, and
it was only as the train steamed out of the station
that &#8220;Fireworks Fenton&#8221; recollected that he had
omitted the special business he had come up to
town to do. But he only frowned and muttered:
&#8220;That ridiculous little Felcourt put it out of my
head, but I&#8217;m glad I found him&mdash;glad I found him.
What fools these dear women are! What fools!
What fools!&#8221; and whenever he turned over a sheet
of newspaper (of which he didn&#8217;t read a line), he
frowned again, exclaiming: &#8220;What fools!&#8221;</p>

<p>The particular fool Mr. Fenton had in his mind
found two letters beside her plate on the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Tuesday morning. She knew both the handwritings,
and gave a little sigh as she opened that from
Rodney&#8217;s house-master: it would be to ask how
Rodney was getting on: he had always been fond
of the boy, and she had told him nothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;You will, I hope, acquit me of frivolous interference,&#8221;
ran the letter, &#8220;in matters that do not
concern me, when I tell you that I have seen Rodney
and heard from him of the very great change
it has been necessary to make in his life. I greatly
wish that I had known sooner your reasons for
taking him away from school, as I think one of the
chief obstacles could have been, and still can be,
easily removed. Dear Mrs. Felcourt, it is with
considerable diffidence that I venture to ask you
to do me a great favor, namely, to allow me to
undertake Rodney&#8217;s education; my one stipulation
being that he should come back to my house. You
know that where there are twenty to thirty boys,
one more or less makes but little difference, and
in becoming responsible for the school fees, I am
doing no more than my headmaster did for me.
My mother was left a widow with five children
and very little of this world&#8217;s gear. I am fully
aware how much I shall be the gainer if you allow
me to have Rodney, for, young as he is, he had a
distinct influence upon that mysterious and fluctuating
commodity, the &#8216;tone of the house,&#8217; and I
have not the slightest doubt that he will be able
to make his own way by aid of scholarships, ultimately
earning his own living nearly as soon as if
he had remained in business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me where I have expressed myself
clumsily, and believe me,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">&#8220;Faithfully yours,</span><br />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>It was a long time before Felicia took up the
other letter, which was from Cecil Connop, and of
this one sentence stood out in letters of fire to the
exclusion of everything else:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the boy&#8217;s health will stand it,
Felicia; come and see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Felicia packed her smallest box and went.</p>

<p>When Rodney came back from business that
evening Selina, the parlormaid, informed him that
a lady was waiting in the drawing-room to see
him. Selina, usually so grim, was all &#8220;nods and
becks and wreathed smiles&#8221;; she liked Rodney,
though he did &#8220;throw about his clothes something
shameful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was very tired and his head ached, as it always
did in the evening lately, but something in
the maid&#8217;s tone made him forget his weariness,
and he raced up the stairs certain that only one
lady could have produced such unwonted geniality
on Selina&#8217;s part. But he paused on the mat outside
the door; suppose it should only be his aunt!
She had never come yet, but she might, and how
was Selina to know that he did not care particularly
for his aunt?</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly from the inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>knew</i> nobody else would come upstairs like
that. What were you waiting for, you dear
goose?&#8221;&mdash;and Rodney&#8217;s mother inspected her boy
for herself.</p>

<p>Next day she went to see her brother at his
office, and told him that she had decided to accept
Mr. Fenton&#8217;s offer. She rather surprised Uncle
Henry, she was so decided and so cool; he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
know that Cecil Connop had got up two hours
earlier than usual, in order to have plenty of time
to fortify Felicia for the interview, only leaving
her at the office door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he will refuse to have anything
more to do with us?&#8221; she had asked timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t be so absurdly unjust,&#8221; answered
Cecil stoutly; &#8220;but, even if he were, you have
Rodney to think of. It is a chance in a thousand;
it would be worse than madness to throw it away.
He&#8217;s a square little peg, is Rodney; you&#8217;ll never
fit him into that hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Henry gave in quite graciously, though
he was not best pleased. Had he but known it, he
revenged himself upon Mr. Fenton for his interference
by writing him a solemn letter of thanks,
in which he spoke of his &#8220;generous, nay munificent
offer.&#8221; &#8220;Fireworks Fenton,&#8221; very red and
uncomfortable, rolled the letter into a ball and
dropped it into his waste-paper basket, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pompous idiot!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Rodney went home his little sisters found
him more delightful than ever, but he was reticent
as regarded his experiences in London, describing
it briefly as &#8220;a beastly hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his return to school &#8220;Fireworks Fenton&#8221;
sent for him the very first evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;A row already, Felcourt!&#8221; exclaimed his best
friend in dismay.</p>

<p>But Rodney ran along the passage and knocked
at the study door without any fears on that score.
As he closed the door behind him it was the master
who looked embarrassed, as he jerked out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see you back, Felcourt. Remember
that if you are in any way perplexed, or
get into trouble ... or ... do you want any
pocket-money, by the way?&#8221; and &#8220;Fireworks&#8221;
bent anew over the letter he was writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I have the usual pocket-money, thank
you; but please I would like to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Felcourt, don&#8217;t you see that I&#8217;m busy?
Go away, go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But please, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know perfectly well all the absurd and ridiculous
things you would say, and I very much prefer
that you should not say them. One thing <i>I</i>
have to say, attend to your English prose! I have
a distinct recollection that your spelling of English
is revolting&mdash;positively revolting. Attend
to it!&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What a place to be in is an old library! It seems as
though all the souls of all the writers that have bequeathed
their labors to these Bodleians were reposing
here, as in some dormitory, or middle state. I do not
want to handle or profane the leaves, their winding sheets.
I could as soon dislodge a shade. I seem to inhale learning
walking amid their foliage; and the odor of their old
moth-scented coverings is fragrant as the first bloom of
those sciential apples which grew amid the happy orchard.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Every Easter holidays the schoolmaster went
back to Oxford. Head of a flourishing preparatory
school in the north, a bachelor, absorbed in his
boys, strenuous, matter-of-fact, he yet retained
after some twenty years of monotonous grind a
romantic affection for the dear city of his youthful
dreams.</p>

<p>He always put up at the King&#8217;s Arms, that ancient
hostel with the undulating floors, where the
ale is brown and strong, and the cold beef tender
and streaky. On his very first day he hied him
to a solitude he loved, paid his modest threepence,
and mounted to a favorite haunt of his&mdash;the picture-gallery
of the Bodleian Library.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>It was always empty; it almost always is empty.
Undergraduates know it not; artistic and intellectual
residents appear to scorn its prosaic portraits
of bygone poets and college benefactors, its
humble curiosities. Visitors seldom trouble themselves
to mount the few extra steps leading to it
from the world-famed library below. But the
schoolmaster loved to wander up and down the
second gallery. He loved the double archway with
the traceried roof, where the statue of William,
Earl of Pembroke, stands in the centre, and the
two wide bay windows are filled with pale stained
glass, and one has a deep, comfortable seat.</p>

<p>As usual, the gallery seemed deserted, and the
schoolmaster let the peace of its solitude slide into
his soul, till his spirit was compassed about with a
great calm. He strolled slowly through the gallery,
his hands, holding his straw hat, clasped behind
him. He always uncovered the instant he
entered the little modest door in the corner of the
great quadrangle that leads to so many wonders.
Presently he reached the archway where he was
wont to sit and dream.</p>

<p>With a start of surprise he discovered that it
was already tenanted.</p>

<p>Under the portraits of Ben Jonson and Joseph
Trapp, curled up in a corner of the deep window-seat,
his muddy boots reposing on the sacred oak,
was a boy&mdash;a small, thin boy in Norfolk jacket and
knickerbockers, apparently about twelve years old,
who read absorbedly a popular illustrated magazine.
He never looked up as the schoolmaster approached.
Apparently he neither heard his footstep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
nor realized that the newcomer had paused
to stare at him in speechless astonishment.</p>

<p>Amazement, accompanied by extreme annoyance,
was the schoolmaster&#8217;s predominant emotion.
There seemed to him something incongruous
to the verge of irreverence in anyone daring
to read a modern magazine under the very roof of
the building that contained so much of venerable
scholarship.</p>

<p>It is true that the boy was perfectly quiet. Beyond
the turning of his page, he made no sound
of any sort, and the schoolmaster found himself
watching this reader with a sort of dreadful fascination.
He longed that the child should reach the
bottom of his page and look up. He even gave a
little cough to attract his attention. But the boy
seemed absolutely unconscious of either the
stranger&#8217;s presence or his scrutiny, and read on
unmoved, smiling occasionally at what he read.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster fussed to the end of the gallery,
pausing at every window to look out over
the roofs at the towers and spires of Oxford. Then
he fussed back again along the other side, where
the view consists of the grey-walled quadrangle, a
veritable &#8220;haunt of ancient peace.&#8221; The peace
that had enveloped him on his first entry spread
her wings and fled. Irritation and curiosity had
taken her place, and as he reached the archway
again he stopped and looked at the motionless
little figure in the window.</p>

<p>The boy was no longer reading.</p>

<p>The magazine lay on the window-seat beside
him. His knees were drawn up to his chin, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
arms clasped about them, and he stared unblinkingly
at the portrait of Abraham Cowley on the
wall that faced him.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster walked round the statue of
William of Pembroke till he, too, faced the boy.
This time the child certainly glanced in his direction,
but the glance was of the most cursory order,
and wholly without interest. In an instant he had
returned to his grave contemplation of the poet,
and the schoolmaster might himself have been the
statue of William of Pembroke for any interest
he excited.</p>

<p>The boy was pale and thin-faced, with large,
hollow eyes and a tall, wide forehead&mdash;a scholar&#8217;s
forehead, as the schoolmaster, accustomed for
years to the observation of boys, had already
noted. But what latent scholarship was displayed
in the reading of that obnoxious magazine? And
what business, the schoolmaster asked himself
angrily, had a boy of that age to be boxed up indoors
on a fine afternoon in the Easter holidays?</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was a conscientious man in
the pursuit of his calling. From the very first he
had taught himself to look upon boys as individuals.
He loved them; he whole-heartedly wished
them well. They were to him of most absorbing
interest; but he liked to get away from them sometimes,
and nowhere had he been able to pass so
completely from his ordinary life of a hundred
petty duties and anxieties as in the high solitude
of that deserted gallery, set in the very centre of
the scenes he held most dear, now spoilt and desecrated
by this young interloper with his horrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
modern magazine. Why on earth did he choose
to come here?</p>

<p>The schoolmaster could bear it no longer.
&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;why do you come and read
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the boy turned his melancholy eyes upon
his questioner. &#8220;Because,&#8221; he answered, civilly
enough, but without any enthusiasm, &#8220;it is generally
perfectly quiet here.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the faintest perceptible emphasis on
the &#8220;generally,&#8221; not so much impertinent as
gently reproving. Having answered, he turned
his eyes again upon the chubby, smiling countenance
of Abraham Cowley, and silence fell upon
them like a pall.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was baffled, but more curious
than ever. He was quite conscious of the implied
reproach in the &#8220;generally,&#8221; and he noted the absence
of the courteous &#8220;sir&#8221; with which any properly
constituted boy would conclude a remark
made to an elder. But he could not feel that the
boy had been willfully rude. He would try again.
&#8220;May I ask,&#8221; he said pleasantly, &#8220;why you are
so fond of looking at the portrait of Abraham
Cowley?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the boy shifted his gaze from the smug
charms of the poet to the worn and somewhat
homely features of his questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like him cos he&#8217;s so good-tempered&mdash;in this
one,&#8221; was the brief reply.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster came and stood beside the
boy, and looked at the portrait. Above it was another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
also by Kneller, but representing him as
thin and severe-looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re very different, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; the
schoolmaster remarked. &#8220;You&#8217;d hardly think
they were the same man, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect,&#8221; the boy said solemnly, &#8220;in the top
one he&#8217;s been married.&#8221;</p>

<p>This startling supposition fairly took away the
schoolmaster&#8217;s breath. He racked his brains to
remember all he had ever heard or read of Abraham
Cowley, and couldn&#8217;t for the life of him recollect
whether he was married or not. It is not in
the nature of a true schoolmaster to leave a youthful
mind in the darkness of ignorance if he can
be the bearer of a torch whose light may pierce
that gloom, so he said: &#8220;I expect it was his political
troubles that caused so marked a change in his
appearance. Do you know anything about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; the boy answered politely,
but with firm finality.</p>

<p>He took up his magazine again, opened it, spread
it upon his knees, and in one instant was absorbed
in its pages.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster sat down on the window-seat
and gazed alternately at the boy and at the portraits
of Ben Jonson and Joseph Trapp above his
head. Since he had been a little boy himself he
had never felt so snubbed. He was wholly unaccustomed
to be a cypher in the eyes of boys, and
suddenly with devastating force there was flung
upon him the conviction that he never saw a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
boy at all&mdash;that the boys he saw were all carefully
expurgated editions arranged to suit his sensibilities.</p>

<p>A wild spirit of enterprise seduced the schoolmaster.
He felt himself as one who after long
sailing in smooth, familiar waters suddenly sights
an unknown and precipitous shore.</p>

<p>He had come to Oxford to get away from the
boys he thought he knew. What if, at Oxford, he
received real enlightenment with regard to a boy
he did not know? The sunshine faded and the
gallery grew dark. Outside, he heard the soft
patter of a heavy April shower.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought not to read in this light,&#8221; he said
suddenly, &#8220;you will hurt your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked up surprised at this fresh interruption,
but he obediently closed his book:
there is something almost irresistible in the commands
of those accustomed to exert authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you come here often?&#8221; asked the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, whenever I&#8217;ve got threepence to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has no one ever told you that when you are
talking to an older man it is considered polite to
say &#8216;sir&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t know many old men, nor men at
all, for the matter of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Oxford is full of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be. I don&#8217;t know &#8217;em. I only wish
I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy spoke bitterly and his eyes were full
of gloom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go to school?&#8221; this &#8220;older man&#8221;
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m too delicate, so they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who teaches you, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A guv&#8217;ness. I say, do you think we <i>ought</i> to
talk here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no reason why not. This isn&#8217;t the library,
there is no notice enforcing silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked as if he wished there was. He
sat perfectly mute, with his eyes fixed on the
placid portrait over the schoolmaster&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to come downstairs with
me and see some of the curiosities in the library?&#8221;
the schoolmaster suggested beguilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really it was most difficult to make any headway
with this boy. But the schoolmaster possessed
to the full the necessary perseverance of
his craft, so he continued his catechism:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your parents live in Oxford?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any parents, they&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, how sad! With whom do you live,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Written words can in nowise express the snappiness
with which the boy ejaculated this monosyllable.
The schoolmaster felt unaccountably
chilled and worsted, and silence fell upon them
once more.</p>

<p>The black cloud had passed over the Bodleian,
the rain ceased, and the sun shone out again. The
boy swung his feet off the window-seat, put on
his cap and picked up his magazine, and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
a word of farewell, strolled nonchalantly out of
the gallery, leaving the schoolmaster to exclaim
when he had finally vanished, &#8220;Well, of all the
curmudgeony boys it has ever been my lot to
meet, there goes the most curmudgeony!&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Yet he found it difficult to dismiss the ungracious
youngster from his thoughts. Next afternoon he
sought the gallery again, but there was no little
figure curled up in the deep window-seat. The
poet Cowley smiled serenely, the gallery was deserted,
dignified, reposeful as of yore: with all
its mellow charm of faded coloring, that even the
luminous stillness of that April afternoon could
not burnish into real brightness. But the usual
sense of pleasant well-being, and ordered peace,
failed to enwrap the soul of the schoolmaster.
Even as the day before he had found the presence
of the reading figure in the window irritating and
incongruous, so to-day he found its absence singularly
disturbing. He walked once round the gallery,
sat a few minutes looking at the portrait of
Cowley and wondering what mysterious charm it
held for the queer child who loved it, and so into
the dear familiar irregular streets, where he
scanned every boy who passed, in the hope of coming
across his small acquaintance of the day before.
He went every day to the gallery, but no
boy was there. He almost gave up hope of ever
seeing him again, but he did not forget; and when,
eight days after their first meeting, he mounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to the gallery and saw the little figure crouched
in the window as before, with a gaily covered
magazine open on his knees, the schoolmaster&#8217;s
heart beat a little faster, and he hurried forward,
exclaiming: &#8220;Where have you been all these
days?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy started at his greeting, looked up, and
a smile of recognition changed his face so absolutely
that the schoolmaster felt a queer tightening
in the muscles of his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get my pocket-money till a Friday,&#8221;
the boy explained. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t come before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now you are here, let&#8217;s have a chat together,&#8221;
the schoolmaster said genially. &#8220;We
both like this place, let&#8217;s tell each other the reasons
why, and see if they&#8217;re the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down beside the boy, just out of reach
of the muddy boots. The boy, his magazine still
held open on his knees, surveyed his neighbor with
dark, mournful eyes. Now that the smile had
ceased to lighten his face, the schoolmaster was
shocked at the sharpness of the thin cheekbones,
the hollows and the blue shadows under the solemn
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you why I like it,&#8221; said the boy,
&#8220;&#8217;cept p&#8217;r&#8217;aps because it&#8217;s so quiet, no one ever
talks here, and there&#8217;s no women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But women can come here if they like,&#8221; the
schoolmaster objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;They never <i>do</i> like, not when I&#8217;m here,&#8221; the
boy exclaimed eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here every
week for months and months and I&#8217;ve never seen
one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;But why do you object to women?&#8221; the schoolmaster
persisted. &#8220;We should be in a poor case
without them, most of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t object to them,&#8221; the boy said wearily;
&#8220;it&#8217;s them objects to us, and they do talk so&mdash;talk
and talk and talk about their sufferings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sufferings?&#8221; the schoolmaster repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> know,&#8221; said the boy impatiently,
&#8220;women&#8217;s sufferings and votes and things, and
Parliament and injustice and that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suffrage, suffrage, you mean suffrage!&#8221; cried
the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all the same, that&#8217;s what they talk about,
and inferiority and that. One can&#8217;t help being
born a boy, can one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Help</i> it!&#8221; exclaimed the schoolmaster. &#8220;Why,
who&#8217;d be born anything else if they had their
choice?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s pale cheeks flushed. &#8220;Do you really
mean that?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do. It&#8217;s a glorious thing to be a
boy who&#8217;s going to be a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>They</i> don&#8217;t think so, they say it&#8217;s much better
to be a girl; they&#8217;re sorry I&#8217;m a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come,&#8221; the schoolmaster said chaffingly.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect me to believe that. They may
say so in a kind of joke, but they don&#8217;t really
mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know my aunts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no; but I expect they are very like other
ladies, who often say what they don&#8217;t mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy gave one scornful glance in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
of the schoolmaster, lowered his eyes to the
printed page, and was instantly absorbed.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster felt that he was dismissed.
He had been weighed in the balance, and found
wanting in sympathy and insight, a mere stupid
looker-on at the outside of things. Five minutes
ago the boy had welcomed him. Now, it was as
though the child had risen with the royal prerogative,
and closed the interview. The schoolmaster
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>The boy looked up. His eyes were the color
of a still pool in a Devonshire trout stream, brown,
with olive-green shadows, suggesting depths unfathomable.
The schoolmaster instantly seized
upon the small concession, exclaiming: &#8220;I came
here every day in the hope of seeing you again,
and now that you are here, you sit and read.
Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s rather unkind?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy flushed hotly, and once more the transforming
smile illumined his face as he said: &#8220;You
came here on purpose to see me? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, I&#8217;ve known a good many boys
in my time, and I thought you seemed a bit
lonely....&#8221;</p>

<p>The hungry eyes devoured him, and the schoolmaster
stopped in the middle of his sentence, for,
like all Englishmen, he dreaded any manifestation
of feeling, and the boy looked as if he were about
to cry. His fears were groundless, however, for
the child only said: &#8220;How many boys have you
known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather over a thousand, I fancy. You see, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
has been my business to have to do with boys for
over twenty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over a thousand boys&mdash;and I don&#8217;t know one!
How unfair things are, and beastly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked enviously at the grizzled man
who had known so many boys; and the man looked
pityingly at this boy who seemed to have been
somehow cheated of all that makes youth joyous.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it you have no friends of your own
age?&#8221; he said presently. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you beg
your aunts to send you to school? You&#8217;d probably
get stronger directly you got there, with the
regular games and busy life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunts don&#8217;t like schools. They say boys
learn to be tyrants and bullies at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do they? You couldn&#8217;t have fifty tyrants
in one place, or they&#8217;d be the death of one another,
like the Kilkenny cats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunts say,&#8221; the boy continued, &#8220;that I&#8217;m
to be a result. I won&#8217;t be a result. It&#8217;s beastly to
be a result. I&#8217;ll be a policeman when I&#8217;m grown
up. Just you wait. I&#8217;ll stand outside Parliament,
and if a woman comes near I&#8217;ll carry her to jail.
You see if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy spoke with such vindictive bitterness
that the schoolmaster was shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt,&#8221; he said soothingly, &#8220;that
your aunts have good reasons for many of their
views. You cannot possibly judge of such questions
for many years to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d judge if you heard it all day long like I
do,&#8221; the boy retorted. &#8220;It&#8217;s only here I get away
from it. Here in this nice quiet with that fat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
contented chap smiling at me; and now you&#8217;ve
been and made me talk about it, so even <i>he</i> will
know. You&#8217;ve gone and spoilt my place&mdash;it&#8217;s too
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked as if he was really going to cry
this time, and the schoolmaster felt dreadfully
guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about your parents,&#8221; he said hastily.
&#8220;Do you remember them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father died before I was born, and my
mother just after&mdash;she always was very unwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, you ought not to speak about
your mother like that. You shock me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>they</i> say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If anyone was to say to me that my mother was
unwise, I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d knock him down!&#8221; the schoolmaster
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps you knew her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I didn&#8217;t, you see&mdash;and I don&#8217;t think I
could knock Aunt Amabel down&mdash;she&#8217;s very
strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not, of course not,&#8221; the schoolmaster
said hastily. &#8220;I never suggested such a
thing for a moment. I expect you misunderstand
your aunts, and it is possible that they don&#8217;t quite
understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy said nothing. He no longer stared at
Cowley&#8217;s portrait. He stared at the schoolmaster,
and in his melancholy gaze was concentrated all
the bitterness and disappointment of his twelve
short years.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Let us come out and walk by the Cher,&#8221; said
the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The boy followed him obediently, and as they
turned into Catharine Street, slipped his hand into
that of his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve years old,&#8221; thought that worthy, &#8220;and
he takes a fellow&#8217;s hand. Poor little chap!&#8221;
Aloud he said: &#8220;Boys generally take each other
by the arm, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly his companion seized him by his, and
arm in arm they sought the sheltered walk loved
well by Joseph Addison.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>After that they met every day in the quadrangle
of the Bodleian by appointment, and together
mounted to their favorite seat in the picture-gallery.
The boy no longer read a magazine; instead,
he asked questions&mdash;endless, anxious, exhaustive
questions&mdash;as to the usual doings and
habits of boys who lived with each other and were
brought up by men. All his ideas on the subject
were gathered from school stories, and in consequence
were crude and chimerical in the extreme.
It was undoubtedly a shock to him when this
kindly friend of his frankly admitted that he had
frequently caned boys, and that he was supposed
to have &#8220;rather a heavy hand.&#8221; And the schoolmaster
was still more shocked at the bitterness of
soul he discovered in this queer, quiet boy. He
gathered that the aunts&mdash;generally spoken of as
&#8220;they&#8221;&mdash;were ladies wholly absorbed in politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and every kind of movement for the emancipation
of women, and the schoolmaster pictured them as
members of the shrieking sisterhood, ill-favored
and ill-dressed, oblivious of the fact that feminine
political opinions do not necessarily march in
elastic-sided boots. When the boy did condescend
to mention one of his aunts by name it was always
of &#8220;Aunt Amabel&#8221; he spoke. She appeared to be
the guiding spirit of the trio, busy, strong, and
energetic, spending what time she could spare
from politics in the pursuit of all those games
from which the unfortunate boy was debarred by
lack of comrades, and the schoolmaster found himself
thinking with quite unusual enthusiasm of the
sister who kept house for him. At times he had
regretted her exclusively domestic talents. Now
he even began to share her serene conviction that
women were, on the whole, so much superior to
men that only the very foolish could wish to resemble
them.</p>

<p>In the course of their long talks the schoolmaster
had enlightened his companion as to what
constituted, in his simple creed, the whole duty of
boy; and so far as his ideals related to honor and
courage and truthfulness, he found the child singularly
receptive and responsive; but when he
touched on the chivalry that should be shown to
women, when he tried to arouse the protective instinct
that is generally so deeply rooted and spontaneous
in even the most rough and tumble average
boy, he was met by blank incomprehension,
or a veiled hostility that puzzled and depressed
him. &#8220;If this,&#8221; thought he to himself, &#8220;is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
result of the feminist movement on the rising generation
of men, God help the next generation of
women!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men had come up, and the schoolmaster&#8217;s
holiday was nearly ended. In two days more he
would need to return to his duties in the North, to
look after the cricket pitches in the playing-fields,
and to see that all was shipshape for the boys&#8217;
next term. For the last time he met his sad-faced
little friend in Catharine Street. This time they
did not go up to the picture-gallery. It was a
sunny day in late April, when Oxford seems to
burgeon and blossom in a riotous ecstasy of youth
and gladness. River and playing-fields were gay
with lithe, flannelled figures, and everywhere the
air was sweet with the scent of opening lilacs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on the river this afternoon,&#8221; cried
the schoolmaster when he spied the little figure
waiting for him; &#8220;it&#8217;s far too fine to be boxed up
indoors. I&#8217;ll take you in a Canadian canoe. You
must sit very still, you know. You don&#8217;t think
your aunts would mind, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in London. Aunt Amabel comes back
to-night, but she&#8217;ll be off again in a day or two;
she&#8217;s always going to meetings. I&#8217;m jolly glad
she&#8217;s been away this week; she might have wanted
to interfere&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she would mind your coming out
with me, or I wouldn&#8217;t take you. You must tell her
all about it this evening. I&#8217;ll give you my card to
show her, and you can explain how we met.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s dark eyes were mutinous as he took
the proffered card and put it in his pocket, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
said nothing. On the river in the bright sunshine
the schoolmaster noticed how very ill he looked,
and a great desire possessed this kindly soul to
make things easier for the boy. The sight of the
black shadows encircling the sombre eyes that
should have been so bright with youth and hope
decided the schoolmaster to do what he most hated
doing&mdash;to interfere in another&#8217;s affairs, where he
had no possible excuse or even reason for so
doing.</p>

<p>He walked back with the boy to his home, one of
the large, ugly, comfortable houses &#8220;standing in
its own grounds,&#8221; that have sprung up on the outskirts
of beautiful old Oxford: a house that looked
excessively well-to-do and trim and neat. &#8220;Nothing
of Mrs. Jellyby here,&#8221; thought the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t I see you again?&#8221; asked the boy in a
husky whisper, as they reached his gate. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
awful when you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; the schoolmaster said
hastily. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make an arrangement now.
Good-bye, my boy. God bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s wistful eyes were more than he could
bear. The man turned hastily and walked away,
nor once looked back at the watching figure by the
gate.</p>

<p>Next morning he called upon Aunt Amabel about
ten o&#8217;clock. The less conventional the hour, the
more possible did he feel it might be to explain his
errand. She was at home and would see him. The
boy had evidently done his bidding. As he followed
the maid from the drawing-room to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
study, he prayed that some Pentecostal gift of
tongues might be vouchsafed to him.</p>

<p>Aunt Amabel was seated at a large knee-hole
table covered with papers. She rose as he came
into the room and held out her hand. The business-like
table, the litter of papers, was exactly
what the schoolmaster had expected, but the lady
was wholly unlike the lady of his dreams. Tall,
well-dressed, good-looking, and by no means old,
she made things harder for him by her welcome.
&#8220;You are the gentleman who has been so good to
Reginald? It is kind of you to call. I am most
pleased to meet you. He is a somewhat unusual
boy, is he not? We rather pride ourselves on his
taste for old buildings, and things that do not
generally appeal to boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>The schoolmaster mumbled some vague politeness
and seated himself upon a chair which faced
the knee-hole table. Aunt Amabel&#8217;s eyes were
dark, like the boy&#8217;s, but they were bright and
lively, and she turned them now upon her visitor
with full inquiring gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came,&#8221; the schoolmaster said bluntly, &#8220;to
see you about your nephew. He is not well, and I
think his state of health arises largely from the
fact that he has no companions of his own age,
nor suitable interests. Why don&#8217;t you send him
to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he was perfectly conscious that this
self-possessed young woman was misjudging him,
and the knowledge made him even less diplomatic
than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have never considered him strong enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
for school life. He is an unusual child of difficult
temperament. He would be extremely unhappy at
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a superior finality in the lady&#8217;s tone
that roused all the fighting element in the schoolmaster.
&#8220;He could hardly be more unhappy than
he is at present,&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;I know that
this must appear, as indeed it is, a piece of unwarrantable
interference on my part, but, having become
really interested in the boy, I could not reconcile
it to my conscience to leave Oxford without
warning you that if you persist in keeping your
nephew away from the natural companionship,
amusements, and employments of his age, he will
wither away as surely as a plant withers when light
and air are withheld from it. That boy will die.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook a thick forefinger at her, and the scorn
died out of her eyes. The men who most countenance
the woman&#8217;s movement are seldom masterful.
Aunt Amabel began to like this dictatorial
man. It was a new, and not altogether disagreeable,
experience to be rated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a school, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked,
sweetly.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster&#8217;s dun-colored face crimsoned.
&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; he answered hotly, &#8220;if
you imagine that I came to see you because I was
touting for another pupil, pray dismiss the idea
from your mind.&#8221; This time it was Aunt Amabel
who blushed. &#8220;I came because, knowing a good
deal of boys, I feel sure that your nephew is delicate
because he is lonely and unoccupied; he is a
very boyish boy, a boy who needs the companionship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of his own kind. You have an excellent preparatory
school quite near here. Try for a term&mdash;see
what it does for Reginald.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be quite candid,&#8221; said Aunt Amabel, &#8220;we
do not care for the training, mental or moral, that
boys receive at the average preparatory school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try one that&#8217;s not average,&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;There are plenty of them, all fads and flannel
shirts and girls thrown in. He won&#8217;t learn anything,
but what does that matter? It&#8217;s health and
youth and gladness that you want for him, and a
normal point of view; at present that child&#8217;s a
perfect misogynist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady started at the word, and at this critical
moment her nephew came into the room. At
first he did not see his friend of the Bodleian;
when he did he stopped short, looking from his
aunt to her visitor with puzzled, timid eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reginald,&#8221; said Aunt Amabel, &#8220;this gentleman
says you are lonely and unhappy, and that
you would really like to go to school. Is this so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The timid look faded from the boy&#8217;s eyes to be
replaced by one that was almost stern, so earnest
was it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you never said anything to me
about it? You have never complained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the use?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could we know you were not happy
if you never said anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew, without my never saying anything.&#8221;
The boy pointed at the schoolmaster, who sat with
downcast eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;So it appears,&#8221; the lady said somewhat tartly,
&#8220;although you seem to me to have said a good
deal. That will do, Reginald; you may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Reginald did not go. He looked at the
schoolmaster, and he looked at his aunt. He took
a step forward, exclaiming earnestly: &#8220;If you
will let me be like other boys, Aunt Amabel, I
won&#8217;t be a policeman when I&#8217;m grown up; I&#8217;ll give
it up; I&#8217;ll truly be something else.&#8221; The boy spoke
as one who promises to part with some long-cherished
and imperishable ideal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, child!&#8221; exclaimed poor, puzzled Aunt
Amabel, &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what you are talking
about. <i>Do</i> run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said the boy sadly to the schoolmaster,
&#8220;she never <i>can</i> understand,&#8221; and he
hastened from the room.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster rose. &#8220;Believe me,&#8221; he said
gently, &#8220;I do not want your nephew for a pupil.
I&#8217;d far rather keep him as a friend&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean
to say that a master can&#8217;t be a friend to his boys,
but the relationship must necessarily be a little
different, and it has been a pleasant experience to
come across a boy under quite new circumstances.
I wouldn&#8217;t spoil it for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Amabel looked down, and the schoolmaster
noticed that her eyelashes were long and very
black. &#8220;I am sure you mean kindly,&#8221; she said
gently, &#8220;and you may be sure I shall give every
consideration to what you have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>When her strange visitor had gone she sat for a
long time quite still in front of her table, staring
with unseeing eyes at the many papers scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
upon it. She knitted her black eyebrows and
thought and thought, but apparently to no purpose,
for presently she said to herself: &#8220;What
<i>could</i> he mean by calling that little boy a misogynist,
and what on earth could the child mean about
not being a policeman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was waiting for the schoolmaster at the
gate as he went out. &#8220;Well, was it any use?&#8221; he
cried eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear chap,&#8221; said that gentleman, &#8220;you are
a little noodle. That&#8217;s what you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the boy, as he trotted by the schoolmaster&#8217;s
side, found something vaguely comforting in this
cryptic speech.</p>

<p>Every night the Alfresco Entertainers gave their
performance on a little platform set right under
the shadow of the great cliff; while in front of
them, not a dozen yards away, the rhythmic wash
of the sea on a rocky shore seemed a sort of accompaniment
to their songs, much softer and more
tuneful than that of the poor, jingly, rheumatic
piano, which had nothing between it and every sort
of weather save an ancient mackintosh cover.</p>

<p>The village itself was but a shelf of shore with
one long, straggling, lop-sided street: cottage and
shop and great hotel set down haphazard, cheek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
by jowl, all apparently somewhat inept excrescences
on the side of the green-clad cliffs rising
behind them straight and steep, a sheer five hundred
feet, and just across the narrow line of red
road lies the Bristol Channel, with, on a clear day,
the Welsh coast plainly in view.</p>

<p>At ten years old, people are generally found
more interesting than scenery, and Basil took a
great interest in the variety entertainers. They
looked so smart and debonair, he thought, in their
blue reefers, white duck trousers, and gold-laced
yachting caps&mdash;though they none of them ever put
out to sea. There were five of them altogether,
two ladies and three men. Basil did not care so
much about the ladies, in spite of the rows of
Chinese lanterns that outlined the little stage and
shone so pink in the darkness; there seemed no
glamor or mystery about them. They were not
transcendently beautiful like the gauzy good fairy
of pantomime, or the peerless, fearless circus lady
in pink and spangles: neither did they possess the
mirth-provoking qualities of the dauntless three
clad in yatching garb. One always sang sentimentally
of &#8220;daddies,&#8221; or &#8220;aunties,&#8221; or &#8220;chords,&#8221;
that had somehow gone amissing; and the other&mdash;Basil
almost disliked that other&mdash;sang about things
he could in nowise understand, in a hoarse voice,
and danced in between the verses, and she didn&#8217;t
dance at all prettily, for she had thick ankles and
high shoulders.</p>

<p>But the three &#8220;naval gentlemen,&#8221; as Basil respectfully
called them, sang funny songs, and acted
and knocked each other about in such fashion as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
caused him almost to roll off his chair in fits of
ecstatic mirth. Nearly every fine night after dinner,
if nobody wanted him, Harnet, the tall man-servant,
would take Basil, and they sat on two
chairs in the front row and listened to the entertainment.
Sometimes grandfather himself would
come, but he generally went to sleep in his chair
at home; for when a man goes peel-fishing all day,
walking half a dozen miles up the rocky bank of a
Devonshire trout stream to his favorite pool, he is
disinclined to move again, once he has changed
and dined.</p>

<p>The bulk of the audience attending the Alfresco
Entertainment sat on the wall separating shore
from road, or on the curbstone, but there were
always a few chairs placed directly facing the
stage, which were charged for at sixpence each.
Harnet was far too grand and dignified to sit on
either wall or curbstone, and as grandfather always
gave Basil a shilling to put in the cardboard
plate, Harnet preferred to spend it in this wise.</p>

<p>Now all that company had high-sounding, aristocratic
names, except one, who was called, as
Basil said, &#8220;just simply Mr. Smith.&#8221; There was
Mr. Montmorency, the manager, whose cheeks
were almost as blue as his reefer, and his wife,
the lady who danced in the evening, but in the
daytime affected flowing tea-gowney garments and
large flat hats; there was Mr. Neville Beauchamp,
who sang coster songs, to whom the particular
accent required for this sort of ditty really seemed
no effort, as all his songs were given in similarly
pronounced and singular fashion. The lady of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the melancholy ballads was called De Vere; she
looked thin and young and generally cold, as well
she might, for she played everyone&#8217;s accompaniments,
and never wore a coat, however cold the
night. But it was for Mr. Smith that Basil felt
most enthusiasm. In the first place, his speaking
voice was as the voices of &#8220;grandfather&#8217;s
friends.&#8221; In the second, he was, to Basil&#8217;s thinking,
an admirable actor&mdash;changing face and voice,
even his very body, to suit the part he happened
to be playing; and thirdly, he was funny&mdash;funny
in a way that Basil understood. Even grandfather
laughed at Mr. Smith and applauded him,
and when the cardboard plate went round, he sent
Basil with the first bit of gold they had had that
season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever chap that,&#8221; he said as they strolled
homeward under the quiet stars. &#8220;Reminds me
of someone somehow&mdash;looks like a broken-down
gentleman; got nice voice, and nice hands&mdash;wonder
what he&#8217;s doing with that lot?&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil, however, was quite content to admire Mr.
Smith without concerning himself as to his antecedents.
He forthwith christened him &#8220;the jokey
man,&#8221; and it rather puzzled him that, except at
night, the jokey man was hardly ever with the
others, but went wandering about by himself in an
aimless and somewhat dismal fashion. Could it
be that Mr. Montmorency and Mr. Neville Beauchamp
were proud, Basil wondered, because they
had such fine names.</p>

<p>Basil&#8217;s face was as round as a full moon, and
fresh and fair as a monthly rose. Tall and well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
set up, he was good at games, and keen on every
kind of sport. Long days did he spend up the
river with his grandfather fishing for trout&mdash;he
was to have a license for peel next summer, but
had to be content with trout during this. He went
sea-fishing, too, in charge of a nice fisherman called
Oxenham, and caught big pollock outside the bay,
and every morning Oxenham rowed Basil and
Harnet out from the shore that they might have
their morning swim, for the coast is so rocky and
dangerous that bathing from the land is no fun at
all&mdash;though the rocks are very nice to potter about
on at low tide, when energetic persons can find
prawns in the pools.</p>

<p>One day as Basil was busily engaged in this
pursuit, who should come up behind him but the
jokey man, looking as melancholy as though there
was no sunshine, or blue water, or pleasant pools
full of strange sea beasts. Indeed, although he
was by profession such an amusing man, he had
by no means a cheerful face. Tired lines were
written all round his eyes, his shoulders were bent,
and his long slim hands hung loose and listless at
his sides, yet it was plain that he was by no means
old. Moreover, he had changed his smart yachting
suit for an old tweed coat and knickerbockers,
and a grey billycock dragged over his eyes bereft
his appearance of all traces of the jokey man. So
that for a minute or two Basil did not know him,
even although he sat down on a rock close by and
lit his pipe.</p>

<p>Basil was standing bare-legged and knee-deep
in water in pursuit of a particularly active and artful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
shrimp, so that it was only when he at last
lifted his head with an emphatic &#8220;bother,&#8221; that
he noticed the stranger; then he beamed, for
chance had tossed plump into his lap the opportunity
he had long been seeking.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; the little boy inquired politely,
taking off his muffin cap with one wet hand
while he grasped his net with the other. &#8220;I am
so pleased to have met you; I&#8217;ve wanted to for
ever so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of you,&#8221; said the man, and
when he smiled he looked quite young. &#8220;I am
sure the pleasure is mutual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve something most pertickler to ask you,&#8221;
continued Basil eagerly, scrambling out of the pool
to sit on the rock beside him, &#8220;and it seemed as
if I was never to get a chance. It&#8217;s not for myself
either, it&#8217;s for Viola&mdash;you know Viola by
sight, I daresay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it happened that the jokey man, like most
other people in that village, knew Viola by sight
very well indeed. In fact, Viola, and the General,
and Basil, were as speedily pointed out to every
stranger who arrived as though they had been bits
of scenery. For they came every summer and the
village was proud of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she your sister?&#8221; asked the jokey man, suddenly
taking his pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she&#8217;s two year older than me, but she
doesn&#8217;t go to school&mdash;I&#8217;ve been for a year&mdash;she has
a ma&#8217;mselle. I daresay you&#8217;ve seen us with her.
It&#8217;s been such a bore having her here, but she&#8217;s
going to-morrow, and then we shall do just what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
we like, for there will be only Harnet and Polly,
and we like them. Grannie had to go off quite
suddenly to nurse Aunt Alice, and won&#8217;t be back
for a week, so there&#8217;ll be nobody but grandfather
and us; it&#8217;ll be simply ripping,&#8221; and Basil paused
breathless, beaming at the pleasant picture he had
conjured up.</p>

<p>The jokey man put his pipe back into his mouth
and waited; but it had gone out, so he just laid it
on the rocks beside him, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it you wanted to ask me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather difficult to explain,&#8221; Basil began,
turning very red and rumpling his hair. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Viola, you know; she wants so dreadfully to come
to your entertainment. I&#8217;ve told her about it, you
know, but grandfather says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Here Basil
paused, and turned even redder than before:
&#8220;One has to be so particular over one&#8217;s girls, you
know,&#8221; he interpolated apologetically, &#8220;and she&#8217;s
the only girl in our family. Grandfather never
had any sisters or any daughters, so he thinks no
end of Viola, and father and mother are in India,
and he says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That some of the songs are vulgar,&#8221; said the
jokey man shortly. &#8220;So they are; he&#8217;s perfectly
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jokey man looked at Basil, and Basil looked
at the jokey man for a full minute. Then the little
boy said very earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that you could persuade them&mdash;those
other gentlemen, I mean&mdash;to leave out one
or two songs one evening? There&#8217;s that one about
the &#8216;giddy little girl in the big black hat&#8217; that Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Montmorency sings. Grandfather doesn&#8217;t like that
one, and it&#8217;s not very amusing, is it? And Viola
<i>does</i> want to come so dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jokey man made no reply, but stared
straight out to sea with a very grave face. Perhaps
he was thinking of all those other Violas who
listened night after night to the songs the General
objected to, and were perhaps, unlike his Viola,
not &#8220;cared about, kept out of harm, and schemed
for, safe in love as with a charm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil waited politely for some minutes, then, as
the jokey man didn&#8217;t speak, he continued earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see she can just hear that there is music
and singing when the windows are open, and it&#8217;s
so tantalizing, and you see it would be rude to
walk away when we&#8217;d heard you, and come back
next time you sang, wouldn&#8217;t it? It doesn&#8217;t matter
for boys&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at all sure of that,&#8221; said Mr. Smith
hastily; &#8220;it matters very much for boys, too, I
think&mdash;especially if they don&#8217;t happen to have
wise grandfathers with good taste. I&#8217;ll see what
can be done, and let you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you so much!&#8221; cried Basil; &#8220;that
is kind of you. Viola will be so pleased; she&#8217;s up
the village now with Polly, or I&#8217;d fetch her to
thank you herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now while Basil was talking he noticed that the
jokey man&#8217;s coat had got leather on the shoulders,
and that the leather looked as worn as the coat, so
he rightly deduced that at some time or another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
his new friend must have been something of a
sportsman, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you fish at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here,&#8221; said the jokey man, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve done
some fishing in my time. Have you had good
sport?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then immediately ensued a long discussion on
the relative merits of flies, and Basil gave forth
his opinion, an opinion backed up by the experience
of numerous natives, that the &#8220;Coachman&#8221;
was the fly for that neighborhood, but that there
were occasions, especially early in July, when exceedingly
good results might be obtained by using
red ants. They told each other fishing stories.
Basil confided to the jokey man that he had just
got a beautiful new split cane rod from &#8220;Hardy
Brothers,&#8221; promised to show it to him at the earliest
possible opportunity, and they speedily became
the best of friends. For it is a curious fact
that although the actual sport itself is a somewhat
taciturn pursuit, there are no more conversational
sportsmen in the world than ardent followers of
the gentle craft.</p>

<p>Another thing&mdash;they are always courteous listeners,
and generally full of good stories themselves,
yet have the most delicate appreciation of
other people&#8217;s anecdotes. You can nearly always
tell a member of a fishing family by this rare and
pleasing trait.</p>

<p>Next morning the jokey man called at the hotel
and asked for Basil at the door. He wouldn&#8217;t
come in, and when Basil, greatly excited, appeared,
only waited to say hastily: &#8220;If you like to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
your sister to-night, I think I can promise you
that it will be all right.&#8221; Then fled before Basil
could thank him, and was soon pounding up the
steep hill that ends abruptly at the hotel door, as
though he were training for a mountaineering
race.</p>

<p>Basil tore back into their sitting-room to lay the
case before his grandfather, who, for once, was
lunching in the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He promised, you know,&#8221; he concluded jubilantly,
&#8220;so she <i>can</i> come, can&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandfather pulled his moustache and laughed.
Then Viola came and laid her fresh soft cheek
against his, murmuring pleadingly: &#8220;Darling, it
would be so lovely,&#8221; till he pinched Viola&#8217;s cheek
and made stipulations about heavy cloaks, and the
children knew the day was won.</p>

<p>And the end of it all was that, at half-past eight
that evening, grandfather, Basil and Viola were
seated on three chairs in the very middle of the
road that ran past the Alfresco Entertainers&#8217;
stage; but as the road ends abruptly in a precipitous
rock some thirty yards further along, there
is no fear of being run over by traffic.</p>

<p>What an evening of delight that was! How
Basil and Viola laughed, and how pleased was
grandfather! Another thing is quite certain&mdash;that
the Alfresco Entertainers in no way lost by
the alterations they had made in their programme;
the rest of the audience seemed as pleased as Basil
and Viola, and no one appeared to miss the &#8220;giddy
little girl in the big black hat&#8221; the least little bit
in the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Really, it&#8217;s vastly civil of Mr. Thingummy,&#8221;
said grandfather on their way home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grandfather and Harnet had gone fishing for
the whole day. Mademoiselle had departed, only
Polly was left in charge, and she had so bad a
headache&mdash;she put it down to the close, cloudy
weather&mdash;that she was fain to go and lie down
directly she had waited upon Basil and Viola at
their lunch, having given the children permission
to go for a walk along the beach.</p>

<p>It was a grey day, humid and still, and, being
low tide, there seemed no fresh wind blowing in
from the sea as usual. The children scrambled
over the rocks, very happy and important at being,
for once, left to their own devices, and they decided
to make an expedition to a little sandy bay
that can be reached from the shore at low tide,
and to come back by a steep winding path up the
cliffs which terminates in the coach road just
above the village. They had not considered it
necessary to confide their intention to Polly, who
would certainly have objected. They reached the
bay all right, paddled for a little time on the hard,
smooth sand, and then set out to climb the path
which winds in and out of the side of the cliff for
all the world like a spiral staircase up to some
nine hundred feet above the sea. This path is so
narrow that travelers can only walk in Indian file.
On the one side is the steep face of the heather-clad
rock, on the other a sheer drop on to the rocks
below.</p>

<p>When the children had climbed about a third of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the way they found themselves enveloped in white
mist&mdash;a mist so thick, and fine, and clinging, that
you cannot see your own hand held before your
face. It was no use to go down again; the tide
had turned, and soon the sea would be lapping
gently at the foot of the pathway. There was
nothing for it but to go on slowly, carefully, step
by step, feeling all the time for the rocks on the
inner side; by and by the path would widen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, Viola,&#8221; said Basil cheerfully.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll take us a goodish while, but a bit
higher up we can walk together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly frightened,&#8221; said Viola in a
tremulous voice, &#8220;but I rather wish we hadn&#8217;t
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Basil answered fervently. &#8220;If I
hadn&#8217;t been such a juggins I&#8217;d have looked up and
seen the mist on those cliffs long ago. Probably
you can&#8217;t see that there <i>are</i> any cliffs in the village
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>On they toiled, slowly and painfully. It is really
a most unpleasant mode of progression, walking
sideways up a hill with your back against a very
nubbly sort of wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cried Basil presently. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you
hear a call?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children paused, leant against the cliff, and
listened breathlessly. Sure enough someone was
calling. It sounded very muffled and far off; but
it was plainly a man&#8217;s voice, and he was calling
for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s above or below?&#8221; Basil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
asked anxiously. &#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to tell in this
fog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be above, or we should have heard it
before. Call out that we&#8217;re coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil shouted with all the force of his young
lungs, and again the faint, muffled voice answered
with a cry for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; exclaimed Basil in great excitement;
&#8220;we&#8217;ll find him!&#8221; and sure enough in another
bend of the path Basil nearly fell over the
prostrate figure of a man lying right across it,
for here it suddenly grew wider. The man raised
himself on his elbow, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, do you think that when you get to the
village you could send help? I&#8217;m very much afraid
that I&#8217;ve broken my leg. I can&#8217;t stand, and moving
at all hurts it no end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the jokey man!&#8221; Basil cried out in
dismay. &#8220;However did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&#8221; added Viola. &#8220;This is
sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>None of them could see the other, but nevertheless,
the jokey man knew in a minute who had
come to his rescue, and forgot his injuries in his
surprise, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever are you two doing here? Is the
General with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no,&#8221; said Viola proudly; &#8220;we&#8217;re
<i>quite</i> alone, or we shouldn&#8217;t be here, but isn&#8217;t it a
good thing we <i>are</i> here? How did you fall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was mooning along, not thinking where I
was going, when down came the mist. I made a
false step and went bang over the edge, but only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
fell on to the path below, not right over, as I
might have done.... Perhaps it would have
been better if I had,&#8221; he added to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go and get help, Basil,&#8221; said
Viola decidedly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll stay and take care of
Mr. Smith till they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith wouldn&#8217;t hear of this. The children
helped him to crawl as near the inner side
as possible, and when they left him he nearly
fainted with the pain of moving. It began to rain,
the cold, soft, wetting rain of a Devonshire summer,
and Mr. Smith groaned and shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry for you,&#8221; said a soft voice close
beside him. &#8220;Is there nothing I could do?
Wouldn&#8217;t you be more comfortable if you were
to rest your head in my lap? It would be a sort of
pillow. Daddie used to go to sleep like that sometimes
out on the moors last summer, when they
were home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Viola, Viola!&#8221; exclaimed the jokey man,
with far more distress than he had yet shown,
&#8220;why did you stay? You will get cold. It&#8217;s raining
already, and they will be ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use worrying about that,&#8221; said
Viola, edging herself nearer. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t leave
you here all alone and hurt, and Basil wouldn&#8217;t let
me go on to the village &#8217;cause of the fog, so of
course I stayed. I hope you won&#8217;t mind very
much; I won&#8217;t talk if you&#8217;d rather not, but I think
I&#8217;d like to hold your hand if you don&#8217;t mind. It
would be comforting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kind little hand was curiously comforting
to the jokey man: he insisted on taking off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
coat and wrapping Viola in it, in spite of all her
protests. Presently the white pall of mist lifted a
little and they could see one another, and it certainly
was a great pleasure to the man lying
against the cliff to watch the little high-bred face
with the kind blue eyes turned in such friendly
wise toward him. Viola was so like Basil, and yet
so entirely individual. Basil&#8217;s face was round,
hers was oval; Basil&#8217;s nose was broad and indefinite
as yet, Viola&#8217;s nose was small and straight
and decided, with the dearest little band of
freckles across the bridge. Basil&#8217;s manner was
extremely friendly, Viola&#8217;s was tender and protecting,
and it was such a long time since anyone
had taken care of the jokey man, that he almost
crooned to himself in the delight of being so
tended. She was very tender in her inquiries
after his aches and pains, expressed a pious hope
that he always wore &#8220;something woolly next him,&#8221;
and being reassured on that head, proceeded to
suggest that he should smoke if he found it comforting.
Then she told him a great deal in very
admirative terms about daddy, and grandfather,
and Basil, for Viola was of that old-fashioned portion
of femininity that looks upon her own mankind
as beings of stupendous strength and wisdom.
The man lay watching her very intently,
but it is not certain that he heard half of what
she was saying. He had the look of one who was
trying to make a difficult decision. The voices of
habit and tradition called very loudly to him just
then&mdash;dared he listen?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Presently Viola&#8217;s voice ceased. She was evidently
waiting for an answer, and none came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any sisters, Mr. Smith?&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith shook his head, then he raised himself
on his elbow, saying earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Viola! I want you to tell me exactly
what you think about something. Suppose
Basil&mdash;of course it&#8217;s utterly impossible, but still&mdash;suppose
that when he was grown up he did something
that annoyed you all very much, something
disappointing and entirely against his father&#8217;s
wishes&#8221;&mdash;he paused, for Viola looked very grave
and pained&mdash;&#8220;and then,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if he
went right out of sight, and you, none of you, heard
anything more about him for nearly a year&mdash;supposing
<i>then</i> he was sorry, said he was sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should never lose sight of Basil,&#8221; said
Viola decidedly, her eyes dark and tragic at the
mere thought. &#8220;At least, I&#8217;m sure I shouldn&#8217;t;
whatever he did I should love him just the same.
You don&#8217;t love people for their goodness&mdash;you
love them because they&#8217;re <i>they</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; asked the jokey man earnestly.</p>

<p>Viola looked hard at him, turned very red, and
said shyly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you could tell me just what you
did? I know it&#8217;s you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man leant back against the wall again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an interesting story,&#8221; he said wearily,
&#8220;but it may pass the time. I was at the &#8217;varsity,
Cambridge. I was always very fond of acting,
and I was extravagant and lazy, too. The very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
term I went in for my degree I was acting in the
A.D.C., and&mdash;I was plucked. My father was furious.
Then came a whole sheaf of debts. He said
I must go back to a small college, live on next to
nothing, work, and take my degree. Instead of
taking my punishment like a man, I quarreled
with everybody, vowed I&#8217;d go on to the stage, and
came to this. I have kept body and soul together,
and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done anything to be
ashamed of since, but I&#8217;m sick and sorry at the
whole business. Yet now that I&#8217;m all smashed up
and useless, it seems somehow mean to go back.
My father&#8217;s a parson, you know, not over well
off, and there are a good many of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the pauses in his story, and there were a
good many, had been punctuated by Viola with
reassuring little pats, and now that the pause was
so long that he seemed to have finished his story,
she turned a beaming face toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>glad</i> they will be!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You
must write to-night directly you get back. How
<i>glad</i> your mother will be!&#8221;</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed his face. &#8220;My mother
died just before I left school,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Viola&#8217;s eyes filled with tears, and she had just
exclaimed, &#8220;And you have no sisters either, you
poor dear?&#8221; when the rescue party, accompanied
by Basil and the nearly frantic Polly, appeared
just below them. They carried the jokey man to
the foot of the cliff and took him back to the village
in a boat, and as his ankle proved to be very
badly broken he elected to go into the cottage hospital
on the hill. The long wait in the wet, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
had not in the least hurt Viola, proved altogether
too much for the jokey man. That night he became
feverish and delirious, and when the children
and the General went to ask for him next
day, they were told that he was very ill indeed,
and that the broken ankle was quite a small matter
in comparison with the pneumonia. That evening
the doctor called on the General, and directly
the performance was over, the General went to
see the Alfresco Players at their lodgings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know who his people are?&#8221;
the General asked Mrs. Montmorency.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never let on that he&#8217;d got any folks, poor
fellah,&#8221; she answered with a sob. She had a kind
heart if her ankles were thick. &#8220;He was never
one to talk about himself, and he&#8217;s never had so
much as a postcard by post since he&#8217;s been here,
that I do know. His real name&#8217;s not Smith at all;
all his linen&mdash;beautiful and fine his shirts are too&mdash;is
all marked &#8216;Selsley.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no idea what part of the country he
came from?&#8221; the General asked. &#8220;Then we could
look in a directory. It would be a horrible thing
if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He joined us in London,&#8221; Mrs. Montmorency
gasped between her sobs, while her tears made
little pathways on her painted cheeks. &#8220;He hadn&#8217;t
any references, but I persuaded my husband to
take him. He carried his references in his face, I
said, and so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve found it, for a nicer,
more obliging, gentlemanly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think, sir,&#8221; Mr. Montmorency interrupted,
&#8220;that he told the little lady anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
about himself when they were up on the cliff together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless my soul!&#8221; exclaimed the General in
great excitement. &#8220;Of course he did; I have it.
Who has got a clergy list?&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally none of the Alfresco Players possessed
such a work, and it was already too late to
knock up the vicar of the parish. But next morning
the General called on the vicar very early, and
then despatched an exceedingly long telegram to
the post office and several bottles of champagne
to the cottage hospital, where Polly, Basil and
Viola hung about the doors all the morning hoping
for better news. The Alfresco Players got out a
green leaflet to the effect that there would be that
night a benefit performance for that talented
artist, Mr. Smith, who had been suddenly stricken
down by serious illness. The General seemed to
send and receive a great many telegrams, and did
not go fishing all that day. At sundown there was
no better news at the hospital, and it seemed exceedingly
probable that the jokey man would joke
no more. The General met the last train, and
drove away from the station accompanied by an
elderly, severe-looking clergyman. They stopped
at the hospital and the clergyman went in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The jokey man was so noisy and talked so continuously
that the hospital authorities had him
moved from the men&#8217;s surgical ward into a little
room by himself. As the matron showed the
strange clergyman into this room, a nurse rose
from the chair at the bedside. The jokey man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
voice was no longer loud, but he kept saying the
same thing over and over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;All day long he keeps repeating it,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful you&#8217;ve come, for he can&#8217;t
possibly last if this restlessness continues.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll come if you send,&#8221; the weak,
irritable voice went on. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you send?
I want my father&mdash;&#8216;father, I have sinned&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
it&mdash;&#8216;father, I have sinned&#8217;&mdash;but I know he&#8217;ll come
if you send. I want my father, I tell you&mdash;why
won&#8217;t you send? I want my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whispering voice persisted in its plaint, the
hot hands plucked at the sheet when other hands
closed over them, holding them firmly, and the
voice he was waiting for said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear son, I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the sick man raised his tired eyes to the
grave grey face bent over him, his troubled mind
was flooded with an immense content, his poignant
restlessness was calmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old father!&#8221; he said softly, and lay quite
still.</p>

<p>The jokey man thought better of it, and didn&#8217;t
die after all. In another week Basil and Viola
were allowed to go and see him. They stood very
hushed and solemn on either side of his bed, for
he looked very thin and white, and was still lying
right on his back, which made him seem more ill
somehow. For quite a minute nobody said anything
at all, till Basil, who held a large folded
bracken leaf in his hand, laid it down on the jokey
man&#8217;s chest and spread it out. A fish speckled
with brown reposed in solemn glory in the midst.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s for your dinner,&#8221; whispered Basil. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only four ounces off the pound. I caught it myself
two hours ago. Viola saw me do it. I think
a &#8216;Coachman&#8217;s&#8217; the best fly after all.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IN DURANCE VILE</h3>
</div>


<p>Gabrielle always remembered the day that the
ringmaster of the circus came to see her pony
jump. She was proud of her pony, who was
dapple grey and Welsh, and could jump nine inches
higher than himself.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was five, and had ridden without a
leading rein for two years, but her father never
let her jump Roland, the pony. So the pony
jumped by himself, greatly to the edification of
the ringmaster who had been bidden to see the
feat.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, Nana called her to
nursery tea, and as she trotted down the long
yard, past the stables, and towards the drive, the
ringmaster turned to Jack Ainslie, Gabrielle&#8217;s
father, and said: &#8220;Has the little Missie hurt her
foot? She&#8217;s a thought lame.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Ainslie looked hastily after the idolized
little figure, and noted that the ringmaster was
right. She <i>was</i> a thought lame.</p>

<p>Hastily excusing himself, he ran after the child.
&#8220;Have you hurt your foot, darling?&#8221; he asked
anxiously. &#8220;You&#8217;re limping a little. Did you
twist your ankle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Daddy dear, I&#8217;m not hurt. I&#8217;m going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
to tea.&#8221; Gabrielle put up her face for the ever-expected
kiss and ran after her nurse. Jack Ainslie
dismissed the subject from his mind and
showed the ringmaster the rest of the horses.</p>

<p>From that day, however, things changed for
Gabrielle. Other people noticed the little limp,
and her parents, terrified and distressed, sent for
the family doctor. He discovered that in some
way, probably at birth, her hip had been dislocated,
and had formed a new socket for itself, and
that henceforth she would limp&mdash;unless&mdash;and here
all the mischief began&mdash;something could be done.
Her father was frantic. Of course something
must be done. That his Gabrielle, his dainty little
lady with her pretty face, her quick intelligence,
and her gracious ways, should be lame&mdash;oh, it
was intolerable! He was broken-hearted and rebellious,
and even his wife&#8217;s steadfast patience
and unchanging tenderness could not make him
resigned. Then began for Gabrielle a series of
visits to London. She was taken from one great
doctor to another till she grew quite used to marching
about on thick piled carpets, clad in nothing
but her sunny hair, while they discussed her interesting
&#8220;case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctors are chilly men,&#8221; said Gabrielle; &#8220;their
hands are always cold to my body.&#8221;</p>

<p>An operation was arranged, but at the last moment
Jack Ainslie drew back, for the surgeons
would not guarantee success, and the family doctor
said grave things about Gabrielle&#8217;s constitutional
delicacy. So it was decided that more
gradual means must be tried to bring about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
desired result. The &#8220;gradual means&#8221; assumed
the shape of an instrument, hideous to behold and
painful to wear. It broke Jack Ainslie&#8217;s heart to
see his little lady cabined and confined in such a
cruel cage, and for the little lady herself it blotted
out the sunshine and made life very grey and
terrible. One thing was quite plain to Gabrielle,
and that was that evidently Nature was very much
to blame in having provided a new &#8220;socket&#8221; for
the poor little dislocated bone. This impertinence
must be interfered with at all costs&mdash;the doctors
seemed to agree upon that. And Gabrielle wondered
why it was so wrong to have no pain, to be
perfectly unconscious of her &#8220;affliction,&#8221; as her
nurse called it, and so interesting (to the doctors)
and right, to be uncomfortable and to wear a hideous
high-soled boot and an iron cage, with crutches
under the arms that pushed her shoulders up to
her ears.</p>

<p>As for the instrument, it was designed and ordered
by three famous surgeons, and it cost the
price of many ponies. Gabrielle tried to be brave.
She was curiously conscious that the pain her parents
suffered was far greater than her own. The
instrument was adjusted in London, and on the
way home in the train her mother asked her many
times, &#8220;Does it hurt you, my darling?&#8221; And
Gabrielle always answered bravely, &#8220;I can bear
it, mother dear; I can bear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>When she got home that night, the poor little
leg was black from the cruel pressure, and Mary
Ainslie broke down and cried till she could cry no
longer. Gabrielle tried to walk bravely in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
cramping irons, and to smile at her parents when
she met their troubled eyes. At first she broke
the thing continually, for she was an active child,
much given to jumping off chairs and playing at
circus on the big old sofa. But by and by all desire
to jump and run left her. She grew high-shouldered,
and would sit very still for hours,
while her daddy told her stories or drove her behind
Roland in a little basket-carriage he had
bought for her. Truly the iron entered into her
soul, the cruel iron that cramped the child&#8217;s soft
body; and Gabrielle&#8217;s eyes grew larger and larger,
and her chin more pointed, while the once plump
little hands were white as the petals of the pear-blossom
outside the nursery window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish people wouldn&#8217;t ask me about it; they
are kind, but I wish they wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gabrielle
would say. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of telling them about the
socket, and I&#8217;m not &#8216;a poor little soul&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;m
daddy&#8217;s little lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>There came to Jack Ainslie a very old college
friend, a doctor, Gabrielle&#8217;s godfather, and devoted
to her, and he was supremely dissatisfied
with her treatment and implored them to take her
to see a young surgeon, a friend of his own, who
was making a great name, and doing wonders for
everyone who came under his care. Jack Ainslie
and his wife needed but small persuasion, and it
was decided that Gabrielle should go to London
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>What hastened the visit was this: Gabrielle
was devoted to fairy lore, and a favorite play of
hers was to be the beautiful princess who is freed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
from giants and dragons and lions by the gallant
&#8220;Boots&#8221; of the Norse tales. Her father always
enacted the part of that redoubtable third son,
and was wont to kneel before her, making extravagant
protestations of his devotion, which she accepted
with gracious condescension. On this particular
afternoon, just after tea, her father proposed
to play the favorite game, but Gabrielle
would have none of it. &#8220;I can&#8217;t be a princess any
more, Daddy; I&#8217;m sure no princess ever wore an
instrument!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like a princess
any more at all.&#8221; Her father caught her up
in his arms, with a great hard sob, which frightened
her, and she stroked his face, saying tenderly:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sorry, dear, dear Dad! I
didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you. I&#8217;ll be a princess, I will,
indeed! I <i>will</i> feel like a princess really!&#8221; The
next day Jack Ainslie and his wife took Gabrielle
up to town. They did not even take the faithful
Nana, for Gabrielle&#8217;s mother could hardly bear to
let any hands but hers touch her darling, ever
since the day that the ringmaster had made his
sad discovery.</p>

<p>Mary Ainslie took Gabrielle to the new doctor
the following morning, while Jack sat in the smoking-room
of the hotel, lighting innumerable cigars
which he did not smoke, and turning over illustrated
papers which he did not see. Then he
turned out of the hotel and walked down Piccadilly,
blundering into the passers-by, and when he
crossed the road, was nearly ridden over by an
omnibus, so blind and stupid was he in his heavy
sorrow. Poor Jack! his honest heart was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
full of grief, for he loved his little lady dearly,
and he felt that unless something were done
quickly, he would soon have nothing but a tender
memory to love.</p>

<p>Gabrielle and her mother were shown into the
new doctor&#8217;s consulting-room at once. He was a
tall young man, with red hair and keen green eyes.
Her mother undressed Gabrielle, all but the &#8220;instrument,&#8221;
which clasped the tender little body,
and seemed so cruelly unnecessary. The young
doctor frowned when he saw it, then he took it off
himself, and Gabrielle noticed that his touch was
as gentle as her mother&#8217;s, and that his hands were
warm. She gave a happy little shake when she
was free of it, a little wriggle and jump of relief.
Then the doctor made her walk, and felt her all
over, after which he rolled her up in a big fur
rug, to sit in front of the fire, while he went into
the next room with her mother. They were not
long away, and on their return Gabrielle looked
up at the doctor with bright, curious eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the instrument hurt you?&#8221; he asked.
Gabrielle looked at it, as it leaned feebly against
a chair, and said: &#8220;It does, rather; but it does its
best not to. I think...!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, any way, you&#8217;re not going to wear it
any more. Are you glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will the socket do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, child; they&#8217;ve talked about you far
too much. The socket will do beautifully&mdash;much
better without it than with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I wear shoes like other little girls?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Certainly; the prettiest shoes that can be
got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not compensatum shoes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; ordinary shoes, exactly alike!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Gabrielle had been arrayed in some
clothes. She noticed that her mother&#8217;s hands
trembled, but that her eyes were glad. The child
looked up at the tall young doctor, who was watching
her with his keen green eyes, and said: &#8220;My
Daddy will be so glad. He will look at me, and not
look so sorry, and there will be no hard things to
stick into him when he cuddles me! He will be so
glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor made a queer little sound in his
throat; then he lifted Gabrielle in his arms and
carried her to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see the end of this street,&#8221; he asked,
&#8220;where the roar and the rumbling sound comes
from? That&#8217;s Oxford Street. Well, in that street
is a beautiful shop full of shoes&mdash;shoes for little
girls&mdash;and you are going there directly, to get the
prettiest pair that mother can find for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May they have silver buckles?&#8221; Gabrielle
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it extremely advisable they should have
big silver buckles. You will walk both fast and
far in buckles shoes, and you must learn to dance
the <i>tarantella</i>, and all the dolls will sit in a row
to watch you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle gave a delighted laugh. &#8220;Will the leg
that wore the irons get fat again, like the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, yes! You mustn&#8217;t think about that
leg any more, but you must do all the exercises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
mother is going to show you, and when you can
hang on a trapeze for twenty minutes, without
falling off, you must write and tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gabrielle&#8217;s mother finished dressing her,
all but her boots. The boot with the &#8220;compensatum&#8221;
sole lay near the instrument. Gabrielle
looked at it with great aversion. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very dry
day,&#8221; said she. &#8220;May I go to the cab in my stockings,
and not put on no shoes till I have my new
ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor pushed the little boot out of sight,
under the chair, with his foot, and said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll
carry you to the cab, and mother or the cabman
will carry you to the shop across the pavement,
and you shall never see that iron horror or that
boot again!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the doctor carried her across the hall, Gabrielle
put her arms round his neck, and kissed him
on both his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes taste very salt!&#8221; she said, &#8220;But
you are the best doctor in the world!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE SURRENDER OF LADY GRIZELL</h3>
</div>


<p>Geordie had found the world a rather draughty
place since that March morning when his mother
went out hunting and was brought back in a
strange secret fashion, and he saw her face no
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your poor Ma&#8217;s met with a haccident, Master
Geordie&mdash;poor lady she&#8217;ve broke her back and
now she&#8217;s gone to &#8217;Eaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Nana explained things to him. New black
clothes came from the tailor&#8217;s, and Geordie went
with Nana to lay flowers upon his mother&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p>At five years old discomfort is felt, rather than
defined; Geordie was conscious of a difference, an
uncomfortable difference in his surroundings, but
by no means directly traced its cause to the loss
of his mother. Nor was he actively miserable. It
is true that he sometimes wondered why Nana so
often omitted his bath in the morning, and why he
was never dressed to go down in the evening; but
in some respects he had quite a dissipated time.
So many people asked him out to tea, and amusement
of which Nana distinctly approved, for she
went too.</p>

<p>Geordie regarded his father with immense admiration,
he was so tall, and handsome, and jolly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
But since that day when everything was altered,
the Hon. Donald Cochran found less time than ever
to devote to Geordie. It is true he did not go out
hunting any more, but he seemed always to be
shut up in that hitherto almost unused room&mdash;called
the &#8220;study,&#8221; sorting papers and interviewing
stout gentlemen, who wore aggressive watch-chains,
and whose footsteps were much lighter
than those of the hunting friends who used to come
about the house.</p>

<p>After a month of vague loneliness and discomfort
there came a change in Geordie&#8217;s fortunes.
His aunt, Lady Grizell Fane, who had been abroad
at the time of Mrs. Cochran&#8217;s death, appeared
upon the scene.</p>

<p>A tall woman, with keen grey eyes, a woman
who observed much and said little&mdash;Lady Grizell
after three days realized the exact position of
affairs. On the fourth day she went back to the
Towers, taking Geordie with her.</p>

<p>Lady Grizell was one of those women, so often
childless, in whom the maternal instinct is passionately
alive. The love of children was a religion
with her, and all the love she would have
lavished on her own child had the fates bestowed
one on her, she lavished upon Geordie.</p>

<p>The world suddenly became a sunny, sheltered
place for the lonely little boy. Baths were plentiful
and nursery tableclothes were clean, as meals
were regular. Above all, somebody wanted him,
somebody took an interest in his doings, and a
great warm human love &#8220;enwheeled him round.&#8221;
A new experience this for Geordie&mdash;no one had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
ever been actively unkind to him, his mother had
looked after his creature comforts thoroughly.
He was always well dressed and well tended, but
she had never found his society particularly interesting,
nor did she manifest any desire to see
him often during the day. Though a fine strong
child, he was too like the Cochrans to be pretty.
Big nose, grey eyes, thin face, high cheekbones,
and dogged mouth, may be well enough in a man,
but in a child are apt to be all indefinite and out
of proportion. No, Geordie was not a pretty child.
Neither was he very clever; but he was honest
and kind-hearted, and he worshipped those who
were kind to him, Aunt Grizell most of all.</p>

<p>Uncle Fane was a philanthropist, absorbed in
blue books and statistics. When Parliament was
sitting he went to London, while Aunt Grizell not
infrequently preferred to remain with Geordie at
the Towers.</p>

<p>Geordie learned to ride with his aunt (his
father had never been able to afford a pony for
him, it takes such a lot of money to keep hunters),
he did gardening with her, and with her he learned
to read indifferently well. But he learned many
things more important than these.</p>

<p>He learned to be immensely proud of &#8220;the
family,&#8221; to hold the reigning house in due respect
certainly, but with reservations in favor of one
Charles Edward, and his descendants, for whose
sake &#8220;the family&#8221; had greatly dared and suffered.
He learned that he must be courteous and deferent
in his manners, true and just in all his dealings,
and that he must control his temper, which, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
that of the rest of the family, was inclined to be
hasty. Moreover, he quickly discovered that his
aunt <i>was</i> herself all she would have him be. To
know that a thing grieved her was enough with
Geordie to prevent its happening again, so they
were very happy.</p>

<p>His father came from time to time to spend a
few days at the Towers, praised his improved appearance,
and his seat in the saddle, took him out
shooting on occasions, and was always profuse in
his thanks to his sister for her care of the boy.</p>

<p>But this happy and peaceful state of things was
not to last. A cloud came over the horizon. Lady
Grizell went about with red eyes and a harrassed
look, and Geordie found Uncle Fane regarding
him with an expression, kindlier than of yore certainly,
but in which he discovered so large a proportion
of pity that he resented it, without knowing
why.</p>

<p>Then Lord Lochmaben, his father&#8217;s eldest
brother, came to the Towers. During his visit, the
child was always hearing scraps of conversation
in which the words &#8220;madness,&#8221; &#8220;that woman,&#8221;
and &#8220;social suicide&#8221; occurred with bewildering
frequency. He felt that in some mysterious way
these irrelevant remarks had some bearing on his
own fortunes. Lord Lochmaben also regarded
him with that strange pitying expression, and during
his lordship&#8217;s visit, Aunt Grizell&#8217;s eyes were
redder, and her manner more perturbed than ever.</p>

<p>At last, one morning at the end of May&mdash;Geordie
will always hate the scent of the lilacs&mdash;Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Grizell called him from his play to come to her in
the morning room.</p>

<p>He came, running through the open French
window, and when he reached his aunt&#8217;s chair she
put her arm round him, saying huskily: &#8220;Geordie
dear! your father wants you at home, until September&mdash;and
then you are to go to school!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Grizell made the announcement abruptly.
To her surprise it was received in absolute silence.
Geordie was, as his aunt herself would have said,
&#8220;utterly dumbfoundered.&#8221; To go to school some
day was natural and proper&mdash;but to go home....
&#8220;Why does father want me now?&#8221; asked Geordie
in a shaky voice. The Hon. Donald never betrayed
any distress at parting from him when he left the
Towers&mdash;what could it mean?</p>

<p>The child was very like &#8220;the family,&#8221; he was
not at all demonstrative, and he &#8220;thought shame&#8221;
to cry.</p>

<p>He flung his arms round his aunt, holding her so
tight that the buttons of his Norfolk jacket made
deep dents on her cheek, and Lady Grizell could
hear how painfully the little heart was thumping.</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute between these
two who understood each other so well; then
Geordie asked: &#8220;When am I to go, Aunt Grizy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a week&mdash;oh, what shall I do without you,
my bonnie man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall come to see you often, shan&#8217;t I?
Papa won&#8217;t want me all the time, and you will ask
him to let me come often, won&#8217;t you, Aunty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Grizell stroked his hair tenderly, but she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
could not deceive even a child, and she shook her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him, my dear, you may be sure. But
I fear he may not be able to grant my request.
Unfortunately, there is a subject upon which your
father and I cannot agree, and he is vexed with me,
and naturally wants his son for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that &#8216;suicide woman&#8217; that is the subject?&#8221;
asked Geordie breathlessly.</p>

<p>Lady Grizell gazed at him in thunderstruck
amazement. &#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whenever I was out walking with Uncle
Lochmaben and Uncle Fane, I kept hearing little
bits about &#8216;that woman&#8217; and &#8216;suicide&#8217; and papa,
so I thought it might be that. I didn&#8217;t listen, truly&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t help hearing, and I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Grizell put back the hair from the boy&#8217;s
square forehead and looked into his honest grey
eyes, then she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Geordie dear, there are always things in life
that we cannot understand, and things we cannot
help; what we must do is to be as brave and honest
as we can, and leave the rest to God. Your dear
father is very lonely and he has recently married
a lady who will be your new mamma. You must
try to be as good and courteous and obedient to
her as you are to me&mdash;and Geordie, son! don&#8217;t
forget me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Lady Grizell broke down, and Geordie
thought it no shame to cry too.</p>

<p>That week was terribly short. At the end of it
Geordie went out into the draughty world again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
while Lady Grizell went about saying like her
more famous namesake: &#8220;Oh, werena my heart
lecht I wad dee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Geordie could never be induced to speak much
about the three months that followed. During
those three months Lady Grizell grew thin and
pale.</p>

<p>One morning she received a letter from the
Hon. Donald in which he informed her that he and
his wife had made arrangements for Geordie to
go in September to an excellent school in the Forest
of Dean where boys received board and education
for the modest sum of twenty guineas a year.</p>

<p>Lady Grizell gave a little cry, and stared at the
letter in her hand as though it had been some
horrible phantom. Then she flew downstairs and
into her husband&#8217;s study, where he sat writing a
report for the Society of Agriculture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Augustus, read this! I am going to see Donald
to-day, and tell him that I will receive his wife&mdash;I
can&#8217;t let my pride stand in the way of that
child any longer&mdash;read this!&#8221; and she thrust the
letter under her husband&#8217;s aristocratic nose.</p>

<p>Mr. Fane put on his glasses, read the letter, took
them off, folded them up and put them in the case&mdash;a
methodical, deliberate man, Mr. Fane&mdash;then
he said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you considered what people will say?
Have you forgotten that everybody knows her
most unpleasant story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help it. People must say what they
please. I will not have Geordie go to such a school,
even if I have to receive half the fallen women in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
London to prevent it. If Lochmaben never marries,
Geordie will be head of our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Grizell spoke with passionate excitement.
Mr. Fane felt that he hardly knew his wife, always
so gentle and dignified, in this woman with the pale
face and blazing eyes. He expostulated forcibly
and at his usual length. If he was somewhat less
conscious of the dignity of the House of Cochran
than was Lady Grizell, he was keenly alive to the
dignity of the House of Fane. But all his exhortation,
all his arguments were of no avail. He
could not shake Lady Grizell&#8217;s determination; and
the afternoon saw her speeding in the express
toward the interview with her brother.</p>

<p>The journey was not long, but the August day
was hot. Lady Grizell felt faint and shaken when
the omnibus (she had been too excited to wire for
a cab) deposited her at her brother&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>The parlormaid looked curiously at the tall lady
who asked so pointedly for <i>Mr.</i> Cochran, and
showed her into the study. No ladies ever called,
and here was an undoubted lady&mdash;&#8220;my lady&#8221; to
boot&mdash;as the sharp girl discovered on reading the
card.</p>

<p>She carried the card to her master in the garden,
where he was sitting with his wife. He flushed
as he read it, and tossed it to the woman beside
him, exclaiming: &#8220;Grizie, by Jove!&mdash;can she be
coming round?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman caught the card, reading the name
aloud in an eager, excited voice, then said, a little
bitterly: &#8220;She only asks for <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t come here to insult you. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Grizie. It&#8217;s something about the boy, and she
wants to be friends. You wait here till I send for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode across the lawn, and entered the
study by the open French window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now this is really good of you, Grizie; Geordie
will be in raptures&mdash;it&#8217;s kind and friendly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Grizell was pale, and the cheek she turned
to his kiss was very cold. She clasped her hands
to stay their trembling and began in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Donald! you said that if I would receive Mrs.
Cochran&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nelly, you mean!&#8221; interrupted the Hon.
Donald.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I would receive your wife&mdash;you would let
me keep Geordie. If I promise to ask you both to
the Towers&mdash;twice every year&mdash;will you let me
have him, instead of sending him to that horrible
school&mdash;will you, Donald? I&#8217;ll educate him, he
shall cost you nothing&mdash;I have a little money, you
know, and Augustus is very generous to me&mdash;will
you let him come to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Donald looked rather shamefaced as he muttered:
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it rather like selling the little chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s selling him into happiness, Donald:
he is such a dear lad, and he loves me, and ...
it isn&#8217;t very easy for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for two minutes. Lady
Grizell&#8217;s heart thumped in her ears.</p>

<p>Overhead there was a sudden patter of little
feet, and Lady Grizell sank upon her knees, sobbing:
&#8220;Oh, give him to me, Donald, for God&#8217;s
sake, give him to me! I cannot bear it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Donald&#8217;s eyes were red as he raised his sister
and gently put her in an easy chair. He patted
her shoulder soothingly, and his voice trembled as
he said: &#8220;Look here, Grizie! you shall have the
boy. There shall be no bargain between us; I
never meant to send him to that beastly school. I
tried it on to fetch you&mdash;as it has&mdash;but I can&#8217;t
play the game so low down as that&mdash;I don&#8217;t set up
for a model parent. I know you&#8217;ll bring him up
better than we should. You can leave this house
without meeting my wife if you prefer it, and I&#8217;ll
send Geordie to you to-morrow. But, if you like
to do a kind and generous thing to a woman who
has known little but unkindness, and shame, and
sorrow all her life, and who is a good and loyal
wife to me, then I say, God bless you, Grizell
Cochran, for you are a good woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Donald was not given to the making of long
speeches. His voice broke many times in the
course of this, and the tears were running down
Lady Grizell&#8217;s pale cheeks. She held out her
hands to him, saying simply, &#8220;Take me to her!&#8221;
and the two tall figures went out across the grass
together.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">A CLEAN PACK</h3>
</div>


<p>Basil sat alone in the schoolroom, although it
was past bedtime. Nurse, like everybody else, had
apparently forgotten him, but Basil, absorbed in
his own thoughts, sat on by the dying fire. There
were always fires in his grandfather&#8217;s house whenever
it was in the least cold, and that August it
was very cold, so cold that grandfather, getting
wet through out shooting, somehow got a chill,
was ill only three days, and now was lying dead
in the big bedroom over Basil&#8217;s head. So Basil
had a good deal to think about. It was not that
death was new to him&mdash;from his earliest infancy
it had been impressed upon him that his father
was dead&mdash;but that he could not by any stretch
of fancy imagine what life would be without
grandfather&mdash;grandfather who was lying with his
beautiful hands crossed on his breast in that long,
light-colored wooden box upstairs.</p>

<p>Basil resented the fact that grandfather&#8217;s coffin
should be made of light wood. It seemed incongruous
and impertinent, somehow, that anything
used by grandfather should be otherwise than old&mdash;old
and rich-colored and seemly; and the child
found himself wondering whether grandfather was
annoyed. There were many things in that bedroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
calculated to annoy him, Basil reflected. In
the first place, when mother took him in that
afternoon that he might lay the asters gathered
in his own garden at his grandfather&#8217;s feet, he remarked
that all the blinds were down, and grandfather
would have hated that, and the windows
were shut, and there was a heavy scent of hot-house
flowers. &#8220;I fear he&#8217;s very uncomfortable,&#8221;
whispered Basil to himself. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be glad to get
to heaven out of that stuffy room.&#8221; For grandfather
had loved air as much as he liked fires.</p>

<p>The horizon of Basil&#8217;s experience was somewhat
limited. It consisted of mother and grandfather,
and of &#8220;other grandfather,&#8221; who lived at Altringham
in Cheshire, and was mother&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>Every year Basil and mother went to Altringham
for six weeks, and life there was so utterly
different from what it was with grandfather that
Basil never ceased to puzzle over it and to wonder
why mother always cried when she came away,
and why &#8220;other grandfather&#8221; always said: &#8220;You
moost bear with the old heathen, Sophia; he&#8217;s been
generous enough as regards mooney, and, remember,
you can be <i>in</i> the world but not of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were aunts, too, at Altringham, who made
a great fuss of Basil for about three days, and then
seemed to find him greatly in the way; while &#8220;other
grandfather&#8221; had a most embarrassing way of
suddenly demanding: &#8220;Well, yoong mon, and
how&#8217;s the ciphering?&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil loved his mother very dearly, but he could
have wished that she took life a little less sadly.
A gentle melancholy characterized her every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
thought, and the child felt rather than understood
that her mental attitude toward her father-in-law
was that of a deprecating disapproval. Grandfather
felt it too, for only a week before Basil had
heard him say to one of the gentlemen who were
tramping the stubble with him: &#8220;We shall never
understand each other, my poor little daughter
and I, though we&#8217;ve lived together seven years.
She&#8217;s as good as gold, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m particularly
<i>difficile</i>, but there it is&mdash;we can never get
the same focus for anything.&#8221; Basil was walking
just behind with the keeper, who blushed up to the
roots of his hair as he called out: &#8220;I&#8217;m here, you
know, grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandfather pulled up short and turned to look
at Basil. Then he gave a queer little laugh.
&#8220;There&#8217;s not much Manchester about the boy,&#8221; he
said, and tramped on.</p>

<p>They all went to London from November till the
end of March, and there grandfather generally
dined at his club and played whist afterward,
while Basil&#8217;s mother had supper with him or had
friends of her own to dinner, just as she liked.
Grandfather could not get on without his rubber.
Even in the country, three times a week three
broughams drove solemnly up the drive, and three
old gentlemen descended therefrom to dine with
grandfather and play whist afterwards.</p>

<p>In London on fine nights he walked to his club,
and Basil used to watch him go from the nursery
window just as he was going to bed; and at the
lamp grandfather always stopped and looked up
at the curly head pressed against the pane, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
he would lift his hat with a grand sweep and walk
on, while Basil hugged himself with the delighted
conviction that <i>his</i> grandfather was the very handsomest
old gentleman in the whole world. And
sometimes grandfather would crush his hat over
his eyes, while a spasm of pain crossed his clean-shaven,
stately old face, and he&#8217;d whisper to himself:
&#8220;My God! how like he is to my poor boy.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the very first things that Basil ever
learned were the different &#8220;suits&#8221; in cards.
Grandfather taught him and gave him a shilling
for every suit as he knew them and the values of
the cards, as in whist. Then he taught Basil
whist, playing double-dummy, and explaining as
they went along: &#8220;I wish you, Basil, to play whist
as a gentleman should, carefully and with due
consideration, with the intelligence and respect
that the game deserves, not like a counter jumper
for penny points.&#8221;</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Basil took to this instruction
much more kindly than to that included
under the heading of &#8220;ciphering,&#8221; or even of
reading and spelling. At six he could play a &#8220;fair
hand,&#8221; at which he was somewhat puffed up, the
only drawback being that mother did not seem to
take any interest in his achievements. She never
played herself, though grandfather impressed
upon her that she was preparing for herself an
unhappy old age; in fact, she did not seem to like
cards at all.</p>

<p>One very wet Sunday grandfather had arranged
four &#8220;hands&#8221; on the library table, and was proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to play a game out of &#8220;Cavendish&#8221; for
Basil&#8217;s instruction, when his mother suddenly
came into the room. She gave one quick glance at
the table with the cards, and came forward and
stood beside it, saying very quietly: &#8220;I do not
wish Basil to play cards on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandfather had risen to his feet as Basil&#8217;s
mother entered the room. It would never have
occurred to him to sit down while his daughter-in-law
was standing; he swept the cards into a little
heap with one swift movement of his beautiful
white old hands, and said, with a grave little bow:</p>

<p>&#8220;I apologize, my dear. I had for the moment
forgotten your&mdash;er&mdash;convictions on this question.
What <i>may</i> we play at?&mdash;for I&#8217;ve made a bet with
myself to keep Basil amused till teatime, and I
don&#8217;t want to lose it.&#8221; Then, turning to Basil&mdash;who,
conscious of the thunder in the air, felt very
unhappy indeed: &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault, my boy.
You&#8217;ve not been naughty. It&#8217;s I who was forgetful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil&#8217;s mother looked from one to the other a
little piteously. She had no weapons wherewith to
meet her father-in-law&#8217;s smiling courtesy. She
might have liked him better had he sometimes
been rude. &#8220;Other grandfather&#8221; was not uniformly
courteous.</p>

<p>On Sunday mornings they all three went to
church together, and grandfather sat under the
big carved tablet which set forth how Basil&#8217;s
father had died at Ulundi, &#8220;aged twenty-nine.&#8221;
Grandfather always carried his daughter-in-law&#8217;s
prayer book for her up to the house, discussed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
sermon with her, and was, as he himself would
have put it, &#8220;vastly agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A piece of coal fell out on the hearth and startled
Basil out of his reverie. He had evidently come
to some decision, for he nodded his head emphatically,
muttering: &#8220;I&#8217;d better do it. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll
be bored if I don&#8217;t, and I mayn&#8217;t get another
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room was quite dark but for the flickering
firelight, which had brightened since that big piece
of coal fell apart. Basil went to his own special
cupboard and took from it a pack of cards, which
his grandfather had given him only last week.
Grandfather never used the same pack on two
consecutive evenings, and gave one to Basil nearly
every week with the instruction: &#8220;Never use dirty
cards, even to build castles with.&#8221; The child had
never played with the ones he held in his hands,
and his big grey eyes filled with tears as he
wrapped them up in a leaf torn out of his copy-book.
Then, laboriously, for Basil was no scribe,
he wrote on the packet, a proceeding which took
a considerable time. He gave a sob as he kissed
his message, but there was no time to be lost.
Slipping off his shoes, he opened the door very
softly, raced across the hall and up the stairs.
The staircase was quite dark, for Chapman had
forgotten to light the lamps.</p>

<p>When he reached his grandfather&#8217;s bedroom
door he paused with his hand on the handle. His
heart was pounding in his ears, and for a full
minute he could not hear whether all was quiet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
the room or not. Opening the door very softly,
and as softly shutting it after him, he ran across
the room and pulled up the blind of the big window
that faced the bed. The moon came out from
behind a bank of cloud, as if to aid him in his
task, and shone full on that strange last couch at
the foot of the bed in which grandfather lay so
still under his coverlet of flowers. Basil pushed
at the heavy window, but it was fastened far out
of his reach, and he could not let in the fresh night
air that grandfather loved. As his eyes grew accustomed
to the lighter room, he came and stood
by that light-colored box that he hated so, lifted
the white cloth covering his grandfather&#8217;s face,
and looked at him long and earnestly.</p>

<p>Basil had very vague notions as to what heaven
was like; but, on reviewing all that he had heard
of it, he came to the conclusion that if there was
no whist there grandfather would be dull, and he
had often heard him say: &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing
that I dread, and that&#8217;s boredom.&#8221; So Basil had
decided that at all costs such a contingency must
be avoided, and grandfather must teach the angels
to play whist. &#8220;They can p&#8217;obably make more
cards when they&#8217;ve seen them,&#8221; said Basil to himself,
and pushed his little packet underneath the
folded hands, kissed them, and turned to go as
softly as he had come.</p>

<p>But the door opened at that moment, and his
mother, candle in hand, stood on the threshold
gazing at the little figure standing full in the
strand of moonlight thrown across the carpet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;What are you doing here, Basil?&#8221; she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to give something to grandfather. Oh,
don&#8217;t take it away from him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The passionate distress in the child&#8217;s voice
moved her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take nothing away from him that you
wish to give him. But what is it? Is it flowers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mother, it is not flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came into the room, closing the door after
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see what it is,&#8221; she said very gently.</p>

<p>Basil stood where he was as though turned to
stone. Would she take it away&mdash;or would she put
it back? He could not see her, for he stood with
his back to her, and seemed incapable of turning
round. His mother, noting the disarrangement of
the flowers, drew out the little packet, and, holding
her candle close, read the inscription in the large
uncertain writing:</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">AN IRON SEAT</h3>
</div>


<p>He sat at one end of the seat, she at the other,
and the seat was on the cliffs overlooking the sea
at Wolsuth on the Suffolk coast. They say that if
your eyes were strong enough you could see the
coast of Holland; but even with telescopes no one
has yet succeeded in doing that.</p>

<p>At first he hardly noticed her&mdash;she was so small
and still and read her book so assiduously; but she
could have passed a searching examination as to
his appearance, for she had studied it carefully.
She would have told you that he was tall, and thin,
and dark, and &#8220;rather old&#8221;; that his beard was
grey, though his hair was black and decidedly thin
on the top; that his spectacles had gold rims and
the eyes behind them were very kind; that his
manner struck you as extremely grave and decorous:
what impressed her most, however, was that
big, dull, paper-covered book he was always reading.
She was sure it was dull, for <i>she</i> couldn&#8217;t
read a word of it; it was in German&mdash;she knew
that much, and she had tried to pronounce the
title to herself in bed at night, but never came
near it at all, for it looked like this: &#8220;Mendelejeef
Chemie,&#8221; and it would take a very sharp little girl
of ten to make much out of that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>No one ever came to sit between them on that
iron seat; it was far from the esplanade, and overlooked
a lonely part of the beach where there were
no &#8220;entertainments.&#8221; When they had sat there
for several days, the man who read &#8220;Mendelejeef
Chemie&#8221; looked up suddenly to find that his companion
at the other end of the seat was wiping her
eyes with the absurdest little red-bordered handkerchief.
She held her book in one hand&mdash;a somewhat
large and heavy book for such a little hand&mdash;and
wiped her eyes with the other, and yet the man
was sure that she was not unhappy, for her thin
brown cheeks were flushed, and though her mouth
was tremulous it wore a proud and happy smile.
He was devoured by curiosity. What book could
it be that had the power to move a little girl in so
complex a fashion?</p>

<p>He shifted down the seat toward her; but she
was so absorbed in what she was reading that she
never looked his way, and he found that the book
she held in her hand was &#8220;From London to Ladysmith
via Pretoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked round and saw him. Quite
simply and naturally she offered him a share of
her book, saying enthusiastically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it splendid? And my daddie was there
through it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; she said presently.</p>

<p>The man nodded, and she turned the page.
Then, with tears still shining on her cheeks, she
began to read aloud:</p>



<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
<p>&#8220;It was a procession of lions. And presently, when
the two battalions of Devons met&mdash;both full of honors&mdash;and
old friends breaking from the ranks gripped each
other&#8217;s hands and shouted, everyone was carried away,
and I waved my feathered hat and cheered and cheered
until I could cheer no longer for joy that I had lived to
see the day....&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Here she stopped, and, turning her radiant face
to the man beside her, cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad you weren&#8217;t born in any other
century? Isn&#8217;t it a good thing to be in the world
when there are such splendid things happening?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man smiled down at her, saying heartily:
&#8220;It is, indeed!&#8221; And straightway they were
friends.</p>

<p>Ever afterward they sat in the middle of the
seat quite close together, and although Winny&mdash;that
was her name&mdash;continued to read &#8220;From
London to Ladysmith,&#8221; she read it aloud, and
&#8220;Mendelejeef&#8221; lay neglected on the far end of
the seat.</p>

<p>They talked a great deal about the war, and the
man found that this little girl knew all about it,
from the battle of Glencoe to the relief of Ladybrand,
the name and whereabouts of every regiment,
the result of every single engagement big
or little.</p>

<p>He learned that last year her father had been
home on long leave and had brought them all to
Wolsuth, &#8220;and oh! we did have a lovely time!&#8221;
but that this year mother couldn&#8217;t afford it, &#8220;War
risks are so expensive, you know,&#8221; that she&mdash;Winny&mdash;had
been silly enough to get influenza in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
July, and an aunt had consented to let her come
with her own family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and the boys&mdash;there&#8217;s three boys
younger than me: I&#8217;m the eldest&mdash;have got to stay
at home this year. I&#8217;m so sorry, though I&#8217;d far
rather be with them, only I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to get strong.
Daddie said so in his last letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gathered that her aunt and cousins
were not altogether <i>simpatica</i>, though Winny
never said so; still, every day she came and sat on
the iron seat after her bath and talked of her book,
for which she had unbounded admiration, and of
her own small affairs. Being an excellent listener,
the man found himself well amused, for he was
one of those people who keep the best part of
themselves for old friends and little children, and
are always quite misunderstood and unappreciated
by casual acquaintances, which lack of appreciation
doesn&#8217;t trouble them in the least.</p>

<p>He learned that one of the &#8220;boys&#8221; was going
into the Royal Engineers, &#8220;because there you can
live on your pay from the first if you&#8217;re careful,&#8221;
another into the Artillery, &#8220;and we may spare one
for the Navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are you going to be?&#8221; he asked one
day, after they had exhaustively discussed the
futures of the three boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to be a mother,&#8221; she replied,
with immense decision. &#8220;You see, you have such
a lot of people to take care of you and love you,
if you&#8217;re a mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have to take care of them first, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes, just at first&mdash;but afterwards&mdash;&mdash; You
should just see the care we take of mother, daddie
and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked out to sea and tried to picture
the eager little figure at his side as a large comfortable
mother of many children. He tried so
hard that he forgot to answer her last remark,
and she asked anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a good thing to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; he answered heartily. &#8220;It is one
of the oldest and most honorable professions;
mothers are people we can in nowise ever do without.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought,&#8221; said Winny, in a satisfied
voice, &#8220;and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to be; I
made up my mind years ago.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day as he arrived at their trysting place he
discovered that Winny was crying in right down
earnest, and not for joy that Ladysmith had been
relieved. The little red-bordered handkerchief
was screwed up into a tight, wet ball, and the
small figure in blue serge looked very woebegone
indeed. She had taken off her fisherman&#8217;s cowl,
and cast it on the ground beside her; and when
she saw her friend, instead of waving him a gay
welcome as he came up, she shook her curly brown
hair round her cheeks to hide her face.</p>

<p>All this was so unlike Winny that the man immediately
reflected with dismay that he had not
read the morning paper at all carefully. It was
possible that some disaster had happened to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
father. In those days we were apt to trace all
sorrows to South Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;No bad news, I hope?&#8221; he said in rather a
hesitating way as he came up.</p>

<p>Winny shook her head till her face was entirely
hidden by her hair; but she did not answer otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may as well tell me what&#8217;s the matter,&#8221;
said the man; &#8220;it may not be past mending.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there was something about this man that
inspired confidence; moreover, he offered Winny
his own handkerchief, which was large and clean
and comforting. So she accepted it, mopped her
wet face, shook back her hair, and began: &#8220;I
don&#8217;t bathe with the others, you know.&#8221; Here she
paused so long that the man said, &#8220;Well?&#8221; though
it was against his principles to interrupt anybody&#8217;s
narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bathe at Herrington&#8217;s machines,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;where we always bathed last year&mdash;daddie
too&mdash;right far away at the end of the beach.
My aunt and cousins bathe where the niggers are,
and the concert, and such crowds of people you
have to wait ever so long for a machine. So I
asked if I might bathe with Herrington like last
year, for he&#8217;s such a nice man, and he takes such
care of me, and daddie liked him awfully. There&#8217;s
been Herringtons in Wolsuth since 1400!&#8221;</p>

<p>Winny paused after this announcement, evidently
expecting comment of some sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a long record,&#8221; said the man, rising to
the occasion. &#8220;And what was Mr. Herrington
before he took to keeping bathing-machines?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;He was mate on a schooner, and one of his
sons is a captain of a merchantman; he&#8217;s raised
himself tremendously. Then there&#8217;s two sons who
help Herrington, and are fishermen in winter;
and Mrs. Herrington does washing. Oh, they&#8217;re
such a nice family!&#8221; she exclaimed ecstatically.</p>

<p>The man looked out to sea, wondering what on
earth all this had to do with her tears. But he
was a patient person; so he waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go home to-morrow,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ve had one of Herrington&#8217;s bathing-machines
ever since I came&mdash;going on for three weeks now&mdash;and
he&#8217;s taken me out in the boat and let me dive
and swim, and been so kind and jolly, and to-day,
when I asked my aunt for the money to pay him&mdash;it&#8217;s
fourpence each time&mdash;she wouldn&#8217;t give it me,
and laughed and said that it wouldn&#8217;t hurt him
to take me for nothing this year, he made such a
lot out of us last. Think of it!&#8221; she exclaimed,
clasping and unclasping her hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s his living!
It&#8217;s like taking a leg of mutton from a
butcher for nothing. I told auntie that mother
would send it to her if she&#8217;d let me have it, but
she only laughed and said it was nonsense. Of
course mother will send it to <i>him</i>, but that&#8217;s not
the same. He&#8217;ll have to think me shabby and ungrateful
for nearly three days, for I can&#8217;t go and
say good-bye to him when I&#8217;ve nothing to give
him. I&#8217;ve only sixpence. Isn&#8217;t it dreadful?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man reflected that there were people who
had no objection to accepting legs of mutton from
their butchers, who rather resented the fact that
these same butchers ventured on occasion to send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
in a bill; but evidently the soldier who had been
shut up in Ladysmith brought up his children with
a different view of their obligations. He was very
sorry for Winny, but he didn&#8217;t dare to offer her
the money. There are people to whom one cannot
offer money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell Herrington how you are
placed?&#8221; he feebly suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; the child answered scornfully.
&#8220;He&#8217;d say I was &#8216;more&#8217;n welcome&#8217; to my baths,
and that it didn&#8217;t matter a pin. It&#8217;s just because
I know he&#8217;d gladly give me my baths that it hurts
so. It&#8217;s his <i>living</i>,&#8221; she repeated. As she spoke
she stood up and stuffed the little wet handkerchief
into her pocket.</p>

<p>The man was sitting with his hands thrust deep
into his own, as men will when perplexed or
troubled. Winny stood with her back to him,
gazing sorrowfully at Herrington&#8217;s bathing-machines
on the distant beach.</p>

<p>The little pocket gaped, and the man succumbed
to temptation. Very gingerly he dropped a crown
piece into the opening which displayed the
drenched handkerchief. Then he stood up. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going by the afternoon train,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so I fear
I must say good-bye. But I hope we shall meet
again some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; sighed Winny, as she held up her
face to be kissed, and wondered why he seemed in
such a hurry and never even asked her to walk
back with him.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>I would have our children taught, so far as teaching can
go, to love and admire France, that glorious nation which
has done so much and suffered so much for humanity.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William
Archer</span>, 1898.</p>
</div>


<p>We did not believe it possible that a boy of nine
could wear high-buttoned boots, a pale blue sash,
and long hair like a girl&#8217;s, and yet possess a character
unaffected by these deplorable externals.
That, in addition to this, he should be French,
speaking that &#8220;<i>nimini pimini</i>&#8221; language with perfect
ease; and, in further proof of his mental
slipperiness, speak English almost equally well&mdash;but
for a curious roll and rumble of the letter &#8220;r&#8221;
in the back of the throat&mdash;was another serious
stumbling-block in the way of our liking. It was
not natural. Had he been puny, or sallow, or in
any way physically &#8220;Frenchy&#8221; as we supposed it,
we should have found him less bewildering. But
he was sturdy, ruddy, and fair-haired; tall for his
age, and of a frank cheerfulness that was rather
engaging. Absolutely unashamed of his inferior
nationality, unconscious, seemingly, of those elongated
buttoned boots, he would shake back his
tawny hair and look you squarely in the face with
big blue eyes that smiled. He didn&#8217;t look a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
&#8220;Molly,&#8221; somehow, in spite of his hair; but we
children were convinced that he &#8220;must be one,
really,&#8221; and that what the twins called his &#8220;false
French smile&#8221; was a sort of cloak for the innate
cowardice of his disposition.</p>

<p>What induced Aunt Alice to marry a French
officer, we could not think! That she and her
husband were what mother called &#8220;devoted to one
another&#8221; seemed to us an insufficient explanation.
Not only did she marry this foreigner and desert
her native land, but she became a Roman Catholic&mdash;nurse
minded this most and called her a Papist&mdash;and
she seemed perfectly happy in her exile. She
was supposed to be a very beautiful person, but
what most impressed us during her rare and brief
visits was the quality and quantity of the sweets
she brought us; sweets in gorgeous boxes which
bore the mystic device <i>Gouache</i>. France was, we
were convinced, a poor sort of place, but exception
must be made in favor of her sweets.</p>

<p>In reflecting upon our general attitude toward
France and the French at this time, I am reminded
of the man who scornfully held up to ridicule
a country so far left to itself as to speak of
bread as &#8220;Pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; suggested a more tolerant friend, &#8220;we
call it bread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! it <i>is</i> bread, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>But to return to L&eacute;on. His father&#8217;s regiment
had been ordered to some place in Africa, where
they could not take L&eacute;on, and as Aunt Alice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
going with her husband for at least six months,
L&eacute;on was sent to us.</p>

<p>Eric and I decided that it was a bore. Jennie,
who is queer and contradictory at times, said
nothing. She adores Aunt Alice. The twins, who
had just been doing the Battle of Waterloo in history,
and were rampantly patriotic, expressed
grave doubts as to whether it was quite loyal to
Queen Victoria to receive L&eacute;on at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one likes to go about all day with a mountebank!&#8221;
grumbled Eric.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only he&#8217;d had fewer clothes!&#8221; I sighed.</p>

<p>But even the most sanguine destroyer of garments
could hardly hope that L&eacute;on would wear out
the quantity of which he was possessed in less than
six months.</p>

<p>The twins and L&eacute;on came toward us from the
tennis lawn; the twins red and triumphant, L&eacute;on
red and evidently perturbed. Jennie followed,
lingering in the rear; she is lame, not a cripple,
you know, but noticeably lame.</p>

<p>&#8220;England won!&#8221; shouted the twins. They always
seemed to speak in a sort of chorus.</p>

<p>L&eacute;on sat down on the bank beside us and shook
his hair back from his face. He evidently intended
to appeal to Eric about something; but just as he
opened his mouth to speak, he noticed Jennie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my cousin,&#8221; he called, patting the bank
beside him; &#8220;we shall have good fortune another
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;England won!&#8221; chanted the twins again. &#8220;We
always do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not so!&#8221; cried L&eacute;on angrily. &#8220;Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
do you speak to despise my country? If you were
in France, my guest, we speak not forever of
Hastings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was ages ago,&#8221; said Eric judicially;
&#8220;but you were not fairly matched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;L&eacute;on had me, you see,&#8221; put in Jennie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, my cousin, your play was beautiful,&#8221;
said L&eacute;on, and he took her hand and patted it.
He had queer affectionate ways, and never seemed
to mind showing that he liked people. &#8220;We beat
them next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what makes L&eacute;on so chummy with
Jennie?&#8221; I asked Eric half an hour later, as we
rested after a hot &#8220;single.&#8221; &#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s
because she&#8217;s the only one of us that couldn&#8217;t lick
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eric raised himself on his elbows and stared
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the chuckle-headed ideas I ever
heard! Really, for downright wrong-headedness,
give me the average girl. Can&#8217;t you see, you
silly, that it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s lame, and the little
beggar&#8217;s sorry for her? He&#8217;s a good-hearted kid
if he is Frenchy, and as to licking, just you
wait&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt very much snubbed and rather aggrieved,
for only that afternoon Eric had grumbled about
L&eacute;on&#8217;s clothes and called him a &#8220;mountebank.&#8221;
Boys seem to keep things separate somehow, in a
curious way.</p>

<p>One day Jennie and L&eacute;on had been sent to the
Home Farm to fetch eggs. It was really the twins&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
turn, but they hid so that they shouldn&#8217;t have to
go, for it was a very hot afternoon. Eric and I
went for a stroll through the fields in the same
direction to look at a nest of young yellow-hammers
in the big paddock. There&#8217;s a sort of hill in
the big paddock, and we saw Jennie and L&eacute;on
coming down the cart road from the farm; they
went by the road because Jennie hates climbing
gates&mdash;it hurts her. L&eacute;on was carrying the eggs
and they came very slowly, because Jennie was
tired. Toward them came one, Fred Oram, a village
boy, not a nice boy at all. He hates us because
the head groom gave him a thrashing when
he caught him throwing stones at the thoroughbreds.</p>

<p>Fred Oram began to limp like Jennie, and called
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ullo, Frenchy! Shall I plait your &#8217;air for
ya?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eric, who happened to be at home because two-thirds
of his school got measles and mother was
nervous, began to run, and I ran after him; but
we were a good way from the gate, and the hedge
is too thick to get through. We ran alongside of
it, and heard L&eacute;on say in his funny, stilted English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please hold the eggs, my cousin!&#8221; Then, evidently
to Fred: &#8220;How dare you to mock at my
cousin and insult me?&#8221;</p>

<p>As we reached the gate Eric pulled me back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the kid alone!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
afraid.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>It reminded me of old King Edward, and &#8220;Let
the boy win his spurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>None of the three saw us. Jennie was standing
on the grass at the side, looking very red and
excited; Fred Oram was pulling L&eacute;on&#8217;s hair and
dancing round him, making derisive remarks.
L&eacute;on wrenched his head away, and with a bound
stood in the middle of the road, facing his enemy.
In spite of his buttony boots&mdash;in spite of his blue
sash and his long hair&mdash;Fred seemed rather afraid
of him, for L&eacute;on looked, and was, furious.</p>

<p>For about half a minute they stood looking at
each other. L&eacute;on shouted, &#8220;L&acirc;che! L&acirc;che!&#8221;&mdash;he
forgot to speak English, he was so excited&mdash;then,
&#8220;En garde!&#8221;&mdash;and there seemed a thousand <i>r</i>s
in that <i>garde</i>&mdash;and he sprang on Fred, who went
down like a ninepin.</p>

<p>Eric vaulted the gate, yelling excitedly, &#8220;By
Jove! the kid can box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jennie laid down the eggs on the grass, and hid
her face in her hands. But she looked through her
fingers. I saw her.</p>

<p>In another minute Fred was upon his feet. He
was bigger than any of us&mdash;even Eric. L&eacute;on went
at him again, calling out what we supposed to be
battle-cries in French, and I do believe that the
French alarmed Fred as much as the pommelling.
Anyway, down he went again, with L&eacute;on on the
top of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time!&#8221; shouted Eric, picking upon L&eacute;on and
wiping his face, which was hard to see, for his nose
was bleeding and one eye was swollen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>But Fred got up and began to walk away, remarking
with surly dignity:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for to fight with no French tiger-cats.&#8221;</p>

<p>L&eacute;on broke away from Eric, and ran after his
late foe. Fred stopped and took up a defensive
attitude, but L&eacute;on went up with his grubby right
hand held out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We have foughten; it is
over. Shake with me?&#8221; And Fred shook. &#8220;That
was quite English?&#8221; asked L&eacute;on anxiously, as he
came back to be cleaned.</p>

<p>Eric looked at him very kindly. &#8220;It was all
right,&#8221; he said; and L&eacute;on squared his shoulders
with modest pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw such a nose to bleed!&#8221; exclaimed
Eric, ten minutes later, as the last available handkerchief
had been reduced to a crimson, pulpy ball.
&#8220;There&#8217;s one sash done for, anyway. I suppose
the suit&#8217;ll wash, which is a pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the way home Eric carried the eggs, and
Jennie walked hand in hand with L&eacute;on. They
rather lagged behind, and presently I heard Jennie
whisper&mdash;I have very sharp ears:</p>

<p>&#8220;L&eacute;on, am I so very lame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My little cousin, I do not see you lame at all,
except when you are fatigued; and we all of us
walk badly when we are fatigued;&#8221; and he stopped
and kissed Jennie on both cheeks.</p>

<p>I had often heard that the French say what is
pleasant at the expense of what is true; but just
then I wondered if it was always such a bad thing,
for when I turned and looked at my little sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
her face was perfectly radiant, and she was hardly
limping at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is,&#8221; said Eric, when L&eacute;on
had been carried off by the authorities to have
keys put down his back, his eye bathed, and to be
generally cleaned up; and we were all five sitting
in solemn conclave on the largest wheelbarrow&mdash;the
twins had joined us, much excited by recent
events&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is: you kids must
drop that Waterloo business, and we must none
of us mind his queer clothes any more. He&#8217;s a
ripping good sort, and, after all, he can&#8217;t help
being French!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he wouldn&#8217;t help it if he could!&#8221; cried
Jennie. &#8220;France is a great country.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a wonder nobody contradicted her. We
were all busy readjusting preconceived ideas.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from a busy street in Leith to a
village in the loveliest part of wooded Gloucestershire;
but, at eight years old, vicissitude is borne
with a calm philosophy seemingly unattainable in
later years, and Maggie McClachlan expressed no
great wonder at her new environment, rather to
the disappointment of her worthy aunt, who was
fully aware of her own extreme good nature and
condescension in &#8220;taking the lassie for the whole
summer, and paying her fare <i>both</i> ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Measles followed by an obstinate &#8220;hoast,&#8221; was
the commonplace cause that transported Maggie
to this strange new country. The long, roaring,
whirring, bewildering journey&mdash;in which she was
passed by a kindly official into the varied guardianship
of such passengers as were going her
way&mdash;left her dazed and puzzled, but not unhappy.
Her childless uncle and aunt were kind, and there
were the woods.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Maggie about these
woods was the singular absence of bits of paper;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
neither did she come upon any broken bottles in
the course of her wanderings. This lack seemed
even more wonderful to her than the presence of
innumerable foxgloves. She had spent an occasional
afternoon in the woods at Aberdour, but
always in a crowd. Here the spaciousness and
peace attracted her, even as it filled her little soul
with an awe that was a thing apart from fear. If
in after years Maggie should read what Mr. Henry
James has written of &#8220;a great, good Place,&#8221; she
will understand it better than most people.</p>

<p>For the first week she met with no adventures.
Her aunt, a bustling, busy, thrifty Scotswoman,
worked a great deal up at the big house; her uncle
assisted in the manufacture of the &#8220;superfine
broadcloth&#8221; for which the little village used to be
famous, and Maggie was left to do much as she
pleased. Her cough left her, and the color came
into her pale cheeks, and the sun set his mark
upon the bridge of her nose in the shape of a band
of the dearest little brown freckles.</p>

<p>Hitherto she had not gone far into the woods,
but with returning health came a spirit of adventure.
One afternoon she wandered on and on,
singing softly to herself a ditty relating that
&#8220;Kitty Bairdie had a coo,&#8221; going on to describe
minutely, and at length, the various animals owned
by this worthy lady, and concluding each verse
with the cheerful injunction, &#8220;Dance, Kitty
Bairdie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything seemed to want to sing that afternoon,
and did sing, too, lustily and long. Unconsciously
Maggie raised her voice till the final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
&#8220;Dance, Kitty Bairdie!&#8221; had quite a rollicking
sound, and she found herself doing a sort of double
shuffle among the ground ivy and foxgloves.</p>

<p>It is not easy to dance in and out of ground ivy
and brambles, and Maggie paused for breath, only
to catch it again in a perfect agony of fear, as, not
five yards from her, she beheld a big white figure,
apparently just risen out of the ground.</p>

<p>Paralyzed with terror, she stood staring at the
vision. A tall man it was&mdash;she was sure it was a
man, and no ghost&mdash;clad in curious flowing robes
of soft whitey flannel, falling to his feet in innumerable
folds, while in his hand he held what
Maggie took to be some instrument of torture. It
was a butterfly net; but Maggie did not know this,
for people did not catch many butterflies in Commercial
Street, Leith.</p>

<p>The whole dreadful truth flashed upon her. This
was one of the monks! Had she not read in a
guide to the neighborhood that &#8220;The Dominican
Priory of the Annunciation is a large and handsome
building; here candidates for the priesthood
pursue a course of study in divinity and philosophy.
It is under the government of a Prior.&#8221;
This, then, must be one of the priests, and having
been very well brought up in the strictest sect of
the Free Kirk, she was sure that if only he succeeded
in &#8220;catching her,&#8221; she would be put to unspeakable
tortures, or forced to recant her faith.</p>

<p>Had she not with her own eyes seen her mother
hastily slam the door of their flat in the face of a
woman wearing a queer head-dress and long cloak,
who had come to beg for money?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ha&#8217;e none o&#8217; they Papishes here!&#8221; her
mother exclaimed angrily, and then&mdash;for it was
just before Maggie came south&mdash;&#8220;and you, Maggie,
if you see ony o&#8217; them when you&#8217;re wi&#8217; your
aunty, just turn and flee. I&#8217;m told there&#8217;s a whole
clamjamfray o&#8217; them there, an&#8217; ye can never tell
what they Jesuits will be at.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, having found her breath sufficiently to give
a wild cry, Maggie turned and fled.</p>

<p>The queer white man, who, as she afterward remembered,
looked astonished, called something
after her. But Maggie&#8217;s heart was thumping in
her ears to the exclusion of every other sound, and
she ran blindly on till one treacherous little foot,
more used to pavements than rough forest ground,
gave under her with a horrid wrench, and she fell
forward in a terrified little heap just as she
reached a footpath leading she knew not whither.</p>

<p>There she lay shivering with pain and fear, with
her eyes shut, for she heard the soft swish of long
garments through the undergrowth. Then a
shadow fell upon her, and she was lifted up into
a pair of strong arms, while a voice that even her
excited imagination could not construe as unkindly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe I frightened you, and I&#8217;m awfully
sorry. I don&#8217;t suppose you ever saw such a funny
frock before!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something human and disarming
about the &#8220;awfully&#8221; and &#8220;funny frock&#8221;; moreover,
the owner of the voice did not hold her as
though she were a captive. He sat down at the
foot of the big tree whose gnarled roots had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
tripped Maggie up, and set her on his knee. Besides,
the voluminous flannel garment had a most
reassuring and workaday smell of soap. But she
could not bring herself to open her eyes just yet.
She screwed them and her courage up very tight,
and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll no recant! Ye may burn me, but I&#8217;ll no
recant!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big, queer man threw back his head and
laughed, and his laugh was even more inspiring of
confidence than his speaking voice. But he pulled
himself up short in the very middle of his laugh
to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, though, did you hurt yourself when you
fell?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maggie opened her eyes the tiniest little bit, and
for the first time saw this queer man&#8217;s face. It
was a kind face, a handsome face, with large merry
brown eyes and an exceedingly straight nose. His
mouth was well cut and firm, and when he smiled
as he did then, he showed two rows of admirably
white and even teeth. And the good smell of
soap was in no way deceptive, for there was about
this queer man&#8217;s appearance a radiant cleanliness
that was by no means merely physical. All this
did Maggie gravely take in through half-shut eyes,
and though the pain in her ankle was horrible,
and her heart still danced a sort of breakdown
against her ribs, she was no longer afraid&mdash;only
very, very curious.</p>

<p>The queer tall man, looking down at the face
resting against his arm, noticed that it was small
and white, with long-lashed closed eyes set rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
far apart, and that the little freckles looked pathetically
prominent across the thin small nose;
and even as Maggie was comforted by the good
smell of clean flannel, so he recognized approvingly
that he held in his arms a very clean little
girl, even though her pinafore was patched and
her shoes worn at the toes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, you poor mite?&#8221; he asked
again.</p>

<p>For answer Maggie stuck out the painful foot,
and behold! there was a big lump on the ankle,
and it looked twice as big as the other one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a pretty kettle of fish!&#8221; cried the queer
man. &#8220;You&#8217;ve sprained your ankle.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he set Maggie on the ground beside
him very gently, and diving into the folds of his
habit produced a large handkerchief, which he
proceeded to tear into strips. Then, very gently
and deftly, he bandaged up the poor swollen foot.
By this time Maggie&#8217;s blue eyes were wide open,
and as he stooped over her foot she found time to
wonder why he wore such &#8220;a wee, wee roond cappie&#8221;
on the back of his head. The pain was bad,
but she tried hard not to flinch, and when it was
all done and the bandage fastened with a little
pebble brooch that she had worn at her neck, he
said gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now to carry you home, for that foot must
have hot fomentations as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, however, Maggie demurred. &#8220;I can walk
fine,&#8221; she announced with great dignity, and tried;
but it was no use&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t even stand, the
pain was so bad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>So the &#8220;papist man&#8221; picked her up in his arms
and set off toward the village.</p>

<p>Now, Maggie was just a little anxious at this,
for she had wandered a good way into the park,
and the path he took seemed quite unfamiliar.</p>

<p>With unprecedented courage she took hold of
his chin with her hand and turned his face that
she could see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re no takin&#8217; me to your convent?&#8221;
she asked gravely, as one who begs to know
the worst at once. She still had fleeting visions of
a dungeon followed by stake and faggots if she
proved leal to the faith of her fathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, they wouldn&#8217;t have you there.
We don&#8217;t allow any women to come in&mdash;not even
little girls&mdash;where I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maggie was silent for a minute; then, because
every Scotsman, woman, or child loves an argument,
and a theological argument best of all, she
said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you worship a woman&mdash;images of a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s rather different. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll
discuss that, because, you see, we look at everything
from rather different points of view. How&#8217;s
that poor foot of yours? You&#8217;re a regular Spartan
to bear pain. Am I carrying you comfortably?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was another facer for Maggie; he did not
want &#8220;to discuss that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you liked to burn
everybody wha&#8217; didna &#8217;gree wi&#8217; you&mdash;when ye got
the chance,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not quite so black as we&#8217;re painted,
and the world is big enough for us all nowadays,
even though there are so many more people in it.
Isn&#8217;t that a good thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maggie&#8217;s honest little heart yearned over this
mistaken man, who carried little girls so tenderly,
who seemed so kind and gay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that you were no a papish,&#8221; she said
softly, &#8220;for I&#8217;m sorely afraid that ye&#8217;ll no win
Heaven if you worship graven images.&#8221;</p>

<p>The papist in question stopped short in the
middle of the woodland path. The sunlight shining
through the leaves painted fantastic patterns
on his white draperies, and his eyes were very
kind as he said gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think there will be even more room
in Heaven than there is here for all sorts of
people, provided they are kind, and brave, and
honest, and do their best?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Maggie agreed that it might be possible,
and was something comforted. By and by he
asked her what the nice song was that she had
been singing when he first met her, and she sang
it again for him all through, till he, too, learned
the tune; then she taught him the words, and although
his Scotch left much to be desired, they
made a very considerable noise between them, and
the woods resounded to the strains of &#8220;Dance,
Kitty Bairdie.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;They monks seem different to the ordinary
sort,&#8221; said Maggie that night, when, after much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
fomentation of the injured ankle, her aunt tucked
her into bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just harmless haverals,&#8221; said her
aunt indulgently; but Maggie &#8220;added a wee thing&#8221;
onto her prayers, and whispered under the bed-clothes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please make room for yon clean man at&mdash;any&mdash;rate.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">COMRADES</h3>
</div>


<p>He was called Bunchy because, when a very little
boy, his clothes <i>would</i> bunch; the tiny petticoats
were short for their width, and everything stuck
out all round him like a frill.</p>

<p>Now that he was five, and wore breeches with
four little buttons at the knee, the name still stuck
to him, though it was no longer appropriate.</p>

<p>Bunchy was lonely.</p>

<p>If Pussy had been there it would have been very
different; but she had been sent for quite suddenly
to go and nurse dad, who had incontinently
fallen ill with influenza just three days after
mother (Bunchy always called her Pussy), Nana,
and he had settled down for a fortnight&#8217;s holiday
in a Cotteswold village.</p>

<p>It was a delightful village! It had a green with
noisy geese upon it, a stream that gurgled and
splashed and told fairy tales on sleepy September
afternoons, and real woods surrounded it.</p>

<p>The cottage where Pussy had taken rooms was
ever so pretty, and had a garden full of currant-bushes
and celery.</p>

<p>For three days they had a lovely time. They
sought giants in the woods, finding squirrels instead&mdash;which
were prettier and only less exciting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
they paddled their feet in the stream and caught
minnows in a bottle; they pretended that the geese
on the green were &#8220;Trolls,&#8221; and routed them with
great slaughter; and they had found mushrooms
before breakfast in a neighboring field.</p>

<p>Then Pussy had to go away, and for Bunchy
the face of Nature was changed and clouded.
Only Nana was left, and, although very kind,
she was not an exciting companion. She knew
nothing of giants, and seemed to care very little
about Trolls. Moreover, on this particular morning
she sat indoors making a cotton dress, and
told Bunchy to &#8220;run and play in the garden like
a good little boy, and not worry.&#8221; How can
people, he thought, sit in a room and sew when all
the beautiful out-of-doors seems clamoring for
them to come and admire it?</p>

<p>However, he played in the garden for a while;
but it was rather a small garden, and he grew tired
of being a &#8220;third son&#8221; all by himself, with no one
to admire him, so he came in again and climbed
the steep little staircase. Finding the door of his
mother&#8217;s room open, he went in. The dressing-table
faced the door, and the first thing he saw
was a pair of Pussy&#8217;s slippers standing in front
of it. They had tall curly heels and buckles, such
as she loved, and he remembered how, even with
the tall heels, she did not reach to daddy&#8217;s shoulder.
Somehow the sight of those slippers made
him want her so dreadfully that he couldn&#8217;t stay
in the room or in the garden. He went out into
the road to walk and walk until he should come to
Yorkshire, where daddy was laid up in the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
of a bachelor friend with whom he had gone to
shoot.</p>

<p>It was a very straight road, with a trim path by
the side. By and by he came to some big gates.
There was a little house inside them, all covered
with purple clematis. The gate stood open, and
as Bunchy was rather tired of the neat, straight
road, he turned in, and went down a very broad
gravel path. A little way inside the gate stood
two little churches, one on each side of the path;
beyond them, as far as Bunchy could see, it was
all garden. There were flowering shrubs, and
trees, and lots of grass, but it was unlike any garden
he had ever seen before, for it was full of little
mounds, and there were crosses, and slabs of
stone, and marble angels dotted about among the
mounds.</p>

<p>He turned down a side-path to investigate further
in this strange garden. Nobody was in sight,
and he wandered on by himself till, turning a
corner suddenly, he came upon a man.</p>

<p>The man was dressed in black, and was sitting
on a big stone slab&mdash;a very grew old slab; but
close at his feet there was one of those curious
mounds that puzzled Bunchy, and although this
one had no grass upon it, you could hardly see the
brown earth, for it was almost covered with scattered
flowers&mdash;all of one kind.</p>

<p>Bunchy knew the flower by sight, for Pussy
always wore a bit in her tam-o&#8217;-shanter when she
came back from Scotland. The man did not move
as Bunchy came up to him. The little boy regarded
him with grave brown eyes, and something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
in his expression made Bunchy sure that the man
was sorry.</p>

<p>Now, in Bunchy&#8217;s house, when people are sorry,
Pussy talks about something else, and she does it
so beautifully that they straightway forget their
sorrow in the interest of her remarks. Bunchy
felt that he ought to talk about something else to
this man who looked so sorry; but how can you
change a subject when no subject has been
broached?</p>

<p>So the child went up to the sorry man and lifted
his tam-o&#8217;-shanter, saying politely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you, please, tell me whose garden this is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it is an easy thing to take off a tam-o&#8217;-shanter,
but when you try to put it on again it has
a shabby way of curling up and sitting on the top
of your head so insecurely that it topples off again
directly. Pussy generally put Bunchy&#8217;s on again
for him, and as she wasn&#8217;t there he left the matter
alone and held it in his hand. The man started a
little as Bunchy spoke, then he said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is God&#8217;s garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunchy was not surprised. He felt that he knew
God very well indeed. When you say prayers
morning and evening, and know that there is a
benevolent Somebody somewhere, who gives you
your home, and your parents, and your little white
bed, who likes you to be truthful and courteous,
and to have clean hands at meals, it is quite natural
to hear that this benevolent Person has a garden.
All nice people ought to have gardens, so
Bunchy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does God have so many little rockeries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in His garden? Why are there all these stones,
and figures, and little mounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When people die they are buried in this garden,
and their friends put up the crosses and
stones&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And angels?&#8221; interrupted Bunchy admiringly;
and as he looked up in the man&#8217;s face he noticed
that his eyes were very kind, but that there were
big black shadows round them, and their lids
looked red and heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They put up the crosses, and stones, and
angels to show where their friends are sleeping,&#8221;
continued the tall man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a funeral,&#8221; said Bunchy solemnly,
and there was silence.</p>

<p>The man looked sorrier than ever, and Bunchy
felt that now was the time to talk of something
else, so he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the nearest way to Yorkshire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man seemed to give himself a shake, as
though he were trying to wake up. He held out
his hand to Bunchy, who placed his own in it confidingly;
then he drew the child toward him and
set him on his knee, asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want to go to Yorkshire, old
chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Pussy is there and I am so lonely,&#8221;
Bunchy&#8217;s voice broke. &#8220;I went into her room,
and I saw her shoes&mdash;the ones with the curly heels&mdash;and
they made me want her so bad. They&#8217;re
such tall heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had such little feet,&#8221; murmured the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>And Bunchy saw that he had gone to sleep again,
so he sat very still for a minute or two, then he
said mournfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so lonely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;My Pussy has gone
to sleep. She is not coming back any more. She
is sleeping under the heather here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunchy felt the man&#8217;s shoulder heave as he
leant against him, but he said nothing. He felt
that this was not a time to talk of something else;
this sorryness was something beyond him; so he
stroked the man&#8217;s face with a soft, sticky little
hand, and the corners of his mouth drooped, but
he did not feel quite so lonely.</p>

<p>The man seemed to like the feel of the little
hand, for he bent his head, and, laying his cheek
against Bunchy&#8217;s, said in a queer broken voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you understand, you quaint little
boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry people always understand, and I feel to
love you! Will you come to Yorkshire too? We
should be such nice company.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man seemed to consider; then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long way. I&#8217;m afraid we shouldn&#8217;t get
there by candle-light. You&#8217;d be very tired, and
your shoes would be quite worn out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you carry me a bit sometimes?
Daddy does when I&#8217;m very tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I might do that; but even then we
shouldn&#8217;t get there to-day. How is it you are here
all alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man seemed waking up, and waited quite
anxiously for Bunchy&#8217;s answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Well, you see, Nana was busy sewing, and I
was lonely wivout Pussy, so I thought I&#8217;d walk to
Yorkshire just to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you come to lunch with me instead.
It&#8217;s not so far as Yorkshire; still, it&#8217;s a good way,
and we&#8217;ll go and tell Nana you&#8217;re coming, then
she won&#8217;t be anxious. I don&#8217;t think Pussy would
like you to walk all that way to-day. She&#8217;ll come
back as soon as she can, you may be quite sure.
Will you come? We&#8217;d be nice company, as you
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunchy looked up into the man&#8217;s eyes; then he
slid off his knee, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man got up off the big flat stone and held
out his hand to Bunchy; but the little boy had
knelt down by the mound all covered with heather.
He stooped his curly head and kissed the flowers,
saying in his sweet child&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, man&#8217;s Pussy! I hope you are happy
in God&#8217;s garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he took the man&#8217;s hand and they walked
away together.</p>

<p>But the man had gone to sleep again, for he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay! And though all men, seeing, had pity
on me, she would not see.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">LITTLE SHOES</h3>
</div>


<p>The Vicarage stands at the bottom of the market
place, inside high walls and entered by wooden
gates which generally stand open. Thus the passer-by
can, for a moment, feast his eyes upon the
perfect garden within.</p>

<p>The Vicaress was dead-heading her roses. She
does this carefully every summer afternoon just
after lunch. She had reached the bush of cabbage
roses close to the gate, and her long lath basket
lay on the drive beside her.</p>

<p>The market place was empty and still; nobody
was shopping, for all the world rested preparatory
to attending the Earl&#8217;s garden-party later on.
Road and houses alike glared white in the hot June
sunshine, while in contrast the Vicarage garden
seemed doubly cool and shady. The yew hedge
just inside the gates threw long green shadows on
drive and lawn. Such a lawn it was! Plantains
or dandelions were a thing unknown. Other lawns
might get brown or worn in a drought, but the
Vicarage lawn was watered every night by a
specially constructed hose, that the beauty of its
velvet turf might never vary. The Vicar was wont
to excuse his exceeding pride in his lawn by quoting:
&#8220;The green hath two pleasures: the one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
because nothing is more pleasant to the eye than
green grass finely shorn; the other, because it will
give you a fair alley in the midst.&#8221; It was a
sunken lawn surrounded by smoothly shaven banks
and reached by broad stone steps.</p>

<p>The Vicar and like-minded clerics occasionally
played bowls upon it; but to think of lawn tennis
or croquet in connection with such grass were
little short of sacrilege.</p>

<p>Presently the Vicaress became aware that a
woman stood in the doorway, a woman carrying a
baby, while a little girl of some three years clung
to her skirts.</p>

<p>They stood gazing wistfully into the garden.
As both mother and child wore red kerchiefs instead
of hats, the Vicaress looked for the inevitable
organ, but could not see it.</p>

<p>As she strongly disapproved of indiscriminate
charity she shook her head at them, saying: &#8220;We
never give at the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wearily shifting the baby to her other arm, the
woman answered, with a touch of gentle dignity:
&#8220;I have not ask the senora for money, but if she
permit that we rest on the seat in the shade; we
do no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was soft, and her English refined by
its foreign accent. The Vicaress pointed to a
rustic seat under the yews, saying: &#8220;You may
certainly come in and rest.&#8221; Then she continued
to deadhead the cabbage rose&mdash;it was an untidy
bush that cabbage rose.</p>

<p>As the child toddled past her to climb into the
seat the Vicaress noticed that the little feet made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
red marks on the gravel. The woman pointed to
them with an apologetic shrug: &#8220;The little Zita
she wear out her shoes, her feet bleed. The senora
has a pair of old shoes of her children? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Vicaress shook her head, and a spasm of
pain crossed her face. There were no children at
the Vicarage now. But shoes? Yes! there were
shoes. She bent down to look at the ragged little
feet, and very gently took off Zita&#8217;s shoes. &#8220;Her
feet must be washed,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;Will she
come with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zita shook her curls out of her eyes, but on
further inspection of the senora declined to budge.
&#8220;Then I must bring the water here,&#8221; said the
Vicaress, marching away to fetch it.</p>

<p>She was a tall, thin woman, with keen grey eyes
and a lined, hard face, framed in hair that Nature
had intended to break into fluffy rings of sunlight
round her brow. But the Vicaress coerced her
hair with some abomination that kept it flat and
close to her head. It was only when a shaft of
sunlight struck the tight braid at the back that
one realized it was of the true Titian color. She
went up the wide oak staircase into her cool, sweet-scented
bedroom, where the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> roses
nodded into the windows. Stopping in front of a
big Chippendale wardrobe, she pulled out one of
the deep drawers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to do it!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;but I
never give money, and her little feet were cut and
bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that drawer lay many pairs of half-worn little
shoes&mdash;shoes that had pattered gaily down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Vicarage stairs and danced across the sacred lawn.
Her eyes were very soft as she chose out a pair of
little strap shoes and some woollen socks. Had
the Murillo cherub, chattering in her sweet jargon
of Pyrenean Spanish under the shade of the yew
trees, seen the face of the Vicaress just then, she
would not have refused to go with her. But the
Vicaress kept what Mr. Barrie tenderly calls her
&#8220;soft face&#8221; for solitary places. The best that
people could say of her was, that if her manner
was hard her deeds were often kindly. She filled
a basin with warm water and went through the
silent house into the garden again. Zita laughed
and showed her white teeth as she dabbled her feet
in the water, becoming quite friendly; then the
Vicaress dried her brown legs and arrayed her in
the new shoes and socks. On the party being regaled
with Vicarage cake and milk, the mother
informed her hostess that they purposed to go on
to Gloucester that day&mdash;a fifteen-mile walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no money to go by train?&#8221; asked
the Vicaress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, senora! My &#8217;usban&#8217; sell ze ice cream
there, he cannot send me large money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t get there to-night; where will
you sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders, turning her
unoccupied hand outward with an expressive gesture.
&#8220;In the hedge, senora, it is cool and dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, zay sleep&mdash;and Zita, she walk well till her
foots come to ze ground.&#8221; Then turning to the
child she said something rapidly in Spanish, adding:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
&#8220;She sing for you, senora, you so kind for
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>A la puerta del cielos, venden zapatos</i>,&#8221;
crooned Zita in her funny little nasal chant, and
sang the lullaby right through.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; demanded her hostess
with a queer little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Senora! it is that zay sell shoes at ze doorway
of heaven, to ze ragged little angels who have
none!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman rose, and shouldering the brown
baby, prepared to depart. But the baby, who approved
of Vicarage cake, choked alarmingly, and
delayed matters for a while.</p>

<p>The baby&#8217;s equanimity restored, they bade their
hostess farewell. They had not gone very far,
however, when hearing hasty footsteps behind
them, they turned. It was the Vicaress. She
thrust something into little Zita&#8217;s hand, exclaiming
breathlessly: &#8220;I wish you to go by train; it
is not safe for such babies to be out all night!&#8221;
Then she turned and fairly ran home.</p>

<p>An hour later, as she stood in front of her looking-glass,
smoothing her hair till it looked like a
yellow skull-cap, she said to herself: &#8220;To pay for
a person&#8217;s railway journey is not indiscriminate
charity!&#8221; and her eyes grew tender as she thought
of the little shoes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">&#8220;PASSING THE LOVE OF WOMEN&#8221;</h3>
</div>


<p>&#8220;You sent for me, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, child; I sent for you to say good-bye. I
am going away for some time.&#8221; The woman spoke
deliberately in the monotonous voice of one giving
a piece of information tedious to give.</p>

<p>Angus did not express any surprise, or regret.
The nine years he had spent with his mother had
not helped him to know her. Without in the least
understanding wherein lay her strange aloofness,
he was conscious that he was supremely uninteresting
to her. He wondered why it should be so,
and his honest boyish soul was sometimes troubled.
But children submit readily to the inevitable, and
Angus had his compensations.</p>

<p>Vera Warden looked at her son with more interest
than was usual with her. He was certainly
a handsome lad, tall and well built, with blue eyes
that were both kind and honest. She had been long
in making her decision. Now that it was made she
did not regret: she only wondered if, somehow,
she had missed something that more commonplace
women find easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Angus, dear, you must take care of father.
You and your father are so much alike&mdash;understand
each other so well&mdash;that it will be easy for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
you. You must be especially good to him, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a curious little catch in Vera&#8217;s voice
as she said the &#8220;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you going, mother?&#8221; questioned Angus,
feeling that here was something even more
puzzling than usual in his mother&#8217;s manner.
&#8220;When are you coming back? Father will miss
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he?&#8221; asked Vera wistfully. &#8220;And you,
Angus, will you miss me at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Angus was profoundly astonished. He would
like to have kissed his mother just as he kissed
dad, but he did not dare. He only grew red, and
fidgeted awkwardly, as he answered: &#8220;Of course
I shall miss you, mother&mdash;at meals.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not greed that prompted the child&#8217;s definition,
but the fact that he seldom saw his mother,
except at breakfast and lunch.</p>

<p>Vera Warden did not care for children, and said
so&mdash;frequently.</p>

<p>The carriage came to the door, good-bye being
said without much emotion on either side. As she
was driven out of the big stone gates, Vera gave
herself a little shake, saying: &#8220;And now for life!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later Thomas Warden returned from a
fishing expedition on the other side of the Dale.
The oak trees in the avenue had burst into gold-green
leaf. The big chestnut on the lawn&mdash;the
only chestnut on the estate&mdash;was covered with
cones of pinky blossom. The May sunset touched
the grim grey house with rosy light, and Thomas
Warden felt a welcome in it all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Laying down his rods and fishing-baskets in the
hall, he went straight to his study. There on his
blotting-book lay the letter he had both dreaded
and expected.</p>

<p>His sunburnt face looked grey as he took it up.
He sat down heavily; then, with shaking hands,
opened the letter and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have burnt my boats; there is no going back.
I warned you that it would come to this: that I
would bear the monotony no longer. I have given
you ten years of my life&mdash;the ten best years. Now
I owe it to myself to live&mdash;it may be ten years
more&mdash;but anyway, to <i>live</i>. Marriage and maternity
have, for me, proved uninteresting; but I have
endured them for your sake, and for the sake of
the boy&mdash;while he was quite young. Had he been
in any way an unusual boy I might have found
life more tolerable. To develop his mind would
have been an interest for me; he might have
shared, in some degree, my aspirations after a
fuller intellectual life. But he is a healthy, handsome,
quite commonplace boy, who will grow into
what you would call &#8216;an honest, God-fearing man&#8217;
without my help. He has an excellent governess,
and your good mother will doubtless come frequently
to worship you both. I wish I could free
you of me altogether, and that you could marry
again and be happy. But you are not the sort of
man to bear with equanimity any sort of scandal
or publicity, and you have my promise that the
life I lead shall be such as can give you no
cause for offence other than the fact that I lead
it away from you. For your never-failing courtesy
and kindness I thank you. Believe me, I shall
always have the sincerest affection and respect for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
you. The fact remains, however, that I cannot
lead your life, and you can lead no other. Let us
then separate, and go our different ways in peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;In every conventional and actual sense, I am
and will be your faithful wife,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Vera Warden</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>There was nothing in the letter that she had not
said to him, many times, during the last six
months.</p>

<p>Now, she had actually carried out her so often
announced intention, and was gone; and the realization
stunned him. He felt cold and numbed.
The roar of the beck, in which he had stood all
morning, was in his ears, and he gazed out into the
gathering twilight, seeing nothing&mdash;only conscious
that it was dark and chill everywhere.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and a servant
came in, saying: &#8220;Please, sir, Master Angus is
ready, and would like you to come to him, if you
are not too tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dragging himself out of his chair, he passed his
hand across his dazed, strained eyes. Then he
went out of the room and up the wide old staircase
to his dressing-room, where Angus slept.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a new nightsuit, dad, just like yours.
Look&mdash;pocket and trowsies, and all!&#8221; exclaimed
the child, displaying the latter garments with
great pride. &#8220;Miss Taylor had them made for
me in York. Aren&#8217;t they nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy, yes&mdash;very!&#8221; but the voice was
absent, and Angus felt that there was a something
lacking, something that he generally found there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The child felt frightened. Was dad, too, going
to hold himself &#8220;aloof&#8221;? Would he, too, take to
looking over people&#8217;s heads, and answering in a
far-away voice? The thought was one full of
omen.</p>

<p>Angus gazed into his father&#8217;s face, as he sat
wearily on the edge of the little bed. The child,
if commonplace, was quick to understand those
who loved him. In a moment he acquitted his
father, and came and knelt beside him, rubbing
his curly head against his knees. He said his
prayer with devoutly folded hands, as Grannie had
taught him. Then, climbing into Warden&#8217;s arms,
put his own round his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I sing my psalm, dad? Or are you too
tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>His father held him very close. &#8220;Sing it, laddie.
Sing Grannie&#8217;s psalm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grannie was Scotch. When she came she taught
Angus the psalms in metre. She taught him other
things that he learned more easily than the
psalms; chief among them a great love and trust
in her, and through her, for everything Scotch.</p>

<p>Shortbread was Scotch, and it was good. Scones
were Scotch, and they were good, especially with
currants. Edinburgh rock was excellent; therefore
the psalms, too, were probably superior in
the Scotch version. Angus learned all Grannie&#8217;s
favorites, the first of which was the twenty-third:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My table thou hast furnished,</div>
<div class="verse">In presence of my foes.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>The child always pictured a long table, covered
with a fair white cloth, and plentifully plenished
with plates piled high with scones and shortbread.
He wondered what &#8220;foes&#8221; were, for he hadn&#8217;t
any; he thought they must be the servants who
handed round the plates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely
follow me.&#8221; The sad, patient tune Grannie had
taught him sounded almost triumphant, as the
child&#8217;s strong treble voice rang out. When he had
finished, his father leant his head against the little
rounded shoulder, and there was silence save for
the man&#8217;s quick breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, dad!&#8221; said Angus at last, turning
himself to see his father&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Thomas Warden rose hastily; he laid the boy in
his little white bed, kissed him, and blessed him,
and went down and sat in the study again. But a
man cannot dine in his fishing boots; so he went
upstairs, had a bath, and while he dressed, Angus
discoursed cheerfully to him through the half-open
door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The silence was unbearable; it was so lonely.
Thomas Warden could not sleep. He got up and
walked about his room. Only one o&#8217;clock! The
night had hardly begun.</p>

<p>The moon shone brilliantly, but the wind blew
shrewdly through the open casement. May nights
are cold in the North country.</p>

<p>He went into the dressing-room and looked at
Angus. &#8220;If she had only loved the boy&mdash;if she
had only loved the boy.&#8221; He could have forgiven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
her all the rest. A just and tolerant man, he knew
his own limitations. He granted to the full his
wife&#8217;s intellectual superiority; but she might have
loved the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely
follow me.&#8221; Why did those lines ring in his head?
and then, there always followed the sentence in his
wife&#8217;s letter: &#8220;I cannot live your life, and you can
live no other.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true: <i>he</i> could live no other. But the boy&mdash;why
did she not love the boy?</p>

<p>He drew up the blind, and the mellow moonlight
fell on the sleeping child. Surely he was a goodly
child, so comely, and kindly, and honest. As he
looked at the boy his heart went out to him. He
did not stoop and kiss him as a woman would have
done; he reverenced too much this fair sleep which
wrapped him round. He went back to his own
room and got a pillow. Then, laying his long
length on the floor beside the little bed, and with
the child&#8217;s psalm still sounding in his ears, he too
slept.</p>

<p>The room was flooded with moonlight when Angus
awoke. There was a sound of regular and
heavy breathing. Angus felt puzzled; puzzled, but
not in the least afraid. Such breathing must come
from a man, or a dog; from men and dogs the
child had experienced nothing but kindness.</p>

<p>He sat up, and listening, looked about to see
where the sound came from. He shook his hair
back from his forehead, and rubbed his eyes. Yes!
he was not mistaken, it <i>was</i> his father who lay
there on the floor beside his bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Angus rose softly, and touched his father&#8217;s bare
feet; they were very cold. &#8220;Poor dad,&#8221; he said
to himself&mdash;&#8220;and him so tired!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly he remembered his mother&#8217;s
words: &#8220;You must take care of father.&#8221; It was
bad to sleep without a covering, Grannie had told
him that. He pulled his little quilt off his bed, and
laid it lightly on his father. To his delight the
sleeping figure never stirred, but the quilt was
short, and Thomas Warden was long&mdash;by no
amount of stretching would it cover both his shoulders
and his feet&mdash;poor cold feet! Then Angus
was seized by an inspiration, which even his mother
could not have called quite commonplace. He lay
down at his father&#8217;s feet, and unbuttoning the
jacket of the new sleeping suit, he cuddled up so
that the cold feet rested on his own warm breast.
Then he, too, fell asleep.</p>

<p>The kindly moon shone in upon them, and it was
very still.</p>

<p>When Thomas Warden awoke the moonlight had
changed to pearly dawn. He was no longer cold,
and when he realized why, he was no longer lonely.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">A THROW BACK</h3>
</div>


<p>Nana had at last gone out and left the coast
clear. Kit seized her little brother&#8217;s hand, and
they sped down the long passage to the red baize
door which swung heavily but did not latch, shutting
off the nursery quarters from the house.</p>

<p>Kit was a person of dramatic instincts, and as
they ran down the passage she quoted in a deep
and awful voice, &#8220;The tiger is a fearful beast, He
comes when you expect him least.&#8221; Addison
gazed fearfully over his shoulder, and ran at the
top of his speed.</p>

<p>At last by a mighty effort they pushed open the
heavy red door, and the staircase and the house
lay before them for exploration. It was a very
wide staircase, black and shiny and slippery, and
as they went down their little feet made a pattering
noise which seemed to echo and multiply in the
silent house. Kit turned and said, &#8220;Hush!&#8221; in a
reproving voice to Addison, who was, like Agag,
walking delicately, on the banister side. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
hush any more than I&#8217;m doing!&#8221; he replied in an
injured tone. &#8220;I must put my feet down firm or
I&#8217;d skate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Jakes is in the dining-room, and he&#8217;ll tell us what&#8217;s
for lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the stone-flagged hall, and Kit
opened the dining-room door and marched boldly
in. There was no one there; the big room was
wrapped in silence, and Addison felt very small
and timid as he stood on the threshold. Not so
Kit; she walked boldly up to the table, which was
laid. There was a great deal of old silver on the
table, and many flowers; but its appearance was
evidently most displeasing to Kit, for she exclaimed
angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Addison, just look here! Jakes has
only laid lunch for <i>one</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the mild and gentle Addison was roused to
something like indignation at this tremendous intelligence.
To have breakfast and tea in the nursery
is an understood thing; but lunch&mdash;whoever
heard of a well-conducted child having lunch anywhere
but in the dining-room, once he or she could
hold a spoon and fork? It was abominable; it
had to be seen into at once.</p>

<p>Kit gave an indignant sniff, saying: &#8220;I know it
isn&#8217;t Jakes; it&#8217;s Nana. She&#8217;d go and say we could
have lunch with her till Miss Mercer came; but
I&#8217;ll go and speak to grandpapa at once; it&#8217;s a
shame; I won&#8217;t stand it. Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>The obedient Addison trotted after Kit across
the hall with some alacrity. He hadn&#8217;t seen much
of grandpapa; but what he had seen he liked. How
still the old house was, no sound to be heard but
the drip, drip of the rain on the ivy outside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
windows and the sizzle and fiz of the big logs in
the great stone fireplace.</p>

<p>The children looked upon &#8220;Nanas&#8221; and their
like as necessary evils. They divided mankind
into two classes, which they called respectively
&#8220;the dears&#8221; and &#8220;the deafs.&#8221; To the &#8220;dears&#8221;
belonged father and mother, all father&#8217;s friends
and most of mother&#8217;s; Gaffer and all Gaffer&#8217;s
servants; orderlies&mdash;particularly orderlies&mdash;and
grooms. To the &#8220;deafs&#8221; belonged nurses, governesses,
cross gardeners, and a great many young
ladies who wore smart frocks and were affectionate
in public. These latter were called &#8220;deafs&#8221;
not because of any defect in their aural arrangements,
but simply because the children considered
them incapable of discussing anything interesting.
&#8220;Stupid people!&#8221; Kit was wont to observe, &#8220;who
ask you how old you are, and who fetch stale
cake out of tin boxes, and one&#8217;s got to eat it for
politeness&#8217; sake. Oh, I hate deafs!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Kit reached the study door she knocked,
but there was no answer. &#8220;Mother says he never
hears if he&#8217;s writing,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
in&mdash;come on!&#8221; So she turned the handle of the
door and went in. Grandfather was writing. His
great knee-hole table was piled with open books,
and he had on his gold-rimmed spectacles. He
never looked up as Kit shut the door softly behind
her. For one thing, doors never creaked in grandfather&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>The children stood inside the door and waited,
but he never looked up. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Kit,
as, holding Addison by the hand, they walked leisurely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
across the room, till she stood close by their
grandfather; then she said in a loud and cheerful
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Gaffer; we&#8217;ve come to see
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to see you!&#8221; echoed the ever-obedient
Addison. Grandfather was fond of old-fashioned
things, and the name &#8220;Gaffer&#8221; was so
delightfully inappropriate that he encouraged the
children to use it when they spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve come, have you?&#8221; he said, taking
off his spectacles and turning himself in his heavy
revolving chair toward the children. &#8220;And how
are you, my dears? Did you sleep well after your
long journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not take long to install a child on each
knee. Addison gazed at him in adoring silence,
but Kit hastened to unbosom herself of her wrongs.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to complain!&#8221; she began with dignity.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve only laid lunch for you in the dining-room.
Now I know you&#8217;d like our company.
Mother said we were to keep you company&mdash;will
you give orders about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gaffer seemed duly impressed, as he said: &#8220;I
will give orders at once. Of course you are to
have lunch with me while you are here. It&#8217;s a pity
it&#8217;s so wet for your first day, but it&#8217;s nice to think
that those dear people are going further and
further away from the fogs and damp. It will do
mother so much good to be in a warm climate, and
you must try not to feel dull without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they&#8217;d taken me!&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;I love
hotels!&#8221; Gaffer looked at her and laughed:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
&#8220;What a traveled little person you are! I never
slept in a hotel till I was seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but that&#8217;s long ago. People go about more
now, and, you see, we have to go with the regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To go with the regiment,&#8221; echoed Addison.</p>

<p>Kit conversed affably with her grandfather for
some time; she told him who were her favorite
officers, and which her favorite puddings. She
carefully explained that, as she was four years
older than Addison, she went to bed an hour later,
and that she intended to spend that hour in her
grandfather&#8217;s society. She expressed her approval
of the study as a room, but thought it was a
pity that, owing to the large number of books,
there was no space for any pictures on the walls.
Addison stared about him in solemn silence, till
at last Gaffer suggested that, as he had got to
write to mother, they had better go back to the
nursery till lunchtime. Then they trotted across
the room together, but when they reached the
door and Kit had gone out, Addison raced back
and stood by his grandfather&#8217;s chair, whispering
breathlessly: &#8220;Will you let me see some of the
books some day&mdash;wivout Kit?&#8221; There was a passionate
eagerness in the question which startled
Gaffer. He looked down at the imploring, upturned
face.</p>

<p>And then &#8220;a strange thing happened.&#8221; It was
no longer Addison, his namesake, that he saw; it
was himself. Himself of sixty years ago. There
he stood, the quaint, serious-eyed boy, whose portrait
hung in his dead wife&#8217;s dressing-room. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
boy who longed for books, and who had asked the
same question of a scholar in an Oxford library,
on a long-forgotten morning all those years ago.
With a sudden rush of gratitude he remembered
how the question had been answered, and though
his smile was very pleasant, his voice was a trifle
husky as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wivout Kit?&#8221; persistently questioned the little
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without Kit, I promise,&#8221; repeated Gaffer.
Then he and Addison shook hands, and Addison
followed Kit.</p>

<p>She was waiting in the hall. &#8220;What did you
say to Gaffer?&#8221; she asked inquisitively, but Addison
shook his head. He could keep his own
counsel even when coerced by pinches.</p>

<p>At lunch Gaffer inquired: &#8220;Addison, can you
read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not well!&#8221; answered Kit. &#8220;He can&#8217;t read
well; he&#8217;s only doing &#8216;sequel,&#8217; and he&#8217;s six. He&#8217;s
very backward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Addison, my dear,&#8221; said Gaffer, in
gently reproving tones.</p>

<p>Addison blushed and held down his head; then
he said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like what I read; it&#8217;s so uninteresting.
They ask such silly questions, over
and over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows heaps of poetry!&#8221; said Kit magnanimously.
&#8220;He can learn anything when he&#8217;s
heard it once, and he knows pages of verses, and
psalms, and that, but he&#8217;s no good on horseback.
He&#8217;s got no nerve. Dad says he&#8217;ll never be any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
good across country! And he&#8217;s afraid of the
dark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not nervous?&#8221; asked Gaffer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me nervous!&#8221; said Kit with great scorn. &#8220;I
can ride dad&#8217;s chargers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re like your mother,&#8221; said Gaffer,
smiling at her. &#8220;Now I, I was never any good
across country; but yet I haven&#8217;t found that it has
alienated my friends, or done me any great damage
in life. Has Addison begun Latin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; Miss Mercer doesn&#8217;t teach Latin, and
he&#8217;s far too backward in other things to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I began Greek when I was his age,&#8221; said Gaffer
dreamily; &#8220;but there&#8217;s no reason why Addison
should not begin Latin. He shall begin it with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Addison flushed up to the roots of his hair; then
he scrambled off his seat&mdash;a most unheard-of proceeding
in the middle of lunch&mdash;and ran round to
his grandfather. He threw himself upon him, exclaiming:
&#8220;I love you; oh, how I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kit regarded him with astonished eyes. That
Addison, who never kissed anybody but mother,
who was so undemonstrative, so slow to show feeling,
should behave in this extraordinary manner,
because he was told he might have Latin lessons,
was to her incomprehensible; and Gaffer seemed
to approve, for he lifted Addison on to his knee,
and said in such a queer voice: &#8220;I think we&#8217;re
rather of a kidney, you and I; we&#8217;re going to understand
each other uncommonly well,&#8221; and Addison
sat enthroned on Gaffer&#8217;s knee all the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
of lunch, and shared his cheese. Kit felt injured.</p>

<p>When Gaffer went back to his study he sat down
before the fire, and he pondered for a long time
over his queer little grandson. Then he gave his
shoulders a shake and sighed: &#8220;I was a disappointment
to my father, and he&#8217;ll be a disappointment&mdash;he
is a disappointment&mdash;poor little chap, to
his. He is unaccountably like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lonely child was Addison. The fact that he
was always called Addison from the time he
ceased to be baby was proof enough. A child who
is understood gets a nickname. Kit had fifty.
Addison was always called by his baptismal name.
It was Gaffer&#8217;s name, and Gaffer&#8217;s grandfather
had been called after a gentleman who wrote
poetry and things. Little Addison knew that much,
and he wondered if the writings of that far-away
Mr. Addison were more interesting than &#8220;Step
by Step.&#8221; Addison was called an &#8220;old-fashioned
child&#8221;; he was not very sure precisely what that
was, but that it was something a child ought not
to be, he was convinced. Kit was pretty, very
pretty; so the officers said, not infrequently to
Kit herself. Kit was never afraid of anything by
day or by night. Kit always spoke the truth; Addison
had been known to prevaricate when he was
frightened, and he was often frightened&mdash;at nothing
at all, Kit said.</p>

<p>But the worst and most unforgivable thing
about Addison was this: he had no wish to be a
soldier&mdash;and said so. The sound of a pop-gun
caused his heart to thump against his breast in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
unpleasantly violent manner, and a review was to
him a prolonged agony that made him ill for days.</p>

<p>His mother&mdash;whom he worshipped&mdash;and who
loved him tenderly, was quite unconscious of his
many sufferings. She was absolutely devoid of
nerves herself, and thought that Addison would
grow out of his &#8220;delicacy,&#8221; as she called it. She
was proud of his remarkable resemblance to her
father, whom she admired above all mortal men&mdash;but
she was disappointed; and poor Addison, with
the quick intuition of childhood, was perfectly
aware of it&mdash;at his being what her husband called
&#8220;such a Molly.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it came about that Kit was always brought
forward, and Addison kept in the background&mdash;to
his own satisfaction certainly, but very much
to the detriment of Kit.</p>

<p>Edinburgh, where the regiment was stationed,
was too cold for mother, and dad obtained leave
to take her to the Riviera for the worst months;
so Kit and Addison were sent to Gaffer, and for
Addison it was the turning-point of his life.</p>

<p>To most people, their initiation into the accidence
of the Latin language is not a very happy
recollection. To Addison it is a recollection little
short of rapturous.</p>

<p>To him the first pages of a Latin grammar call
up the picture of a large, old-fashioned room,
flooded with a mellow light like that of the sun
through a veil of yellowing beeches. There is a
goodly smell in the room, the smell of dressed and
well-kept leather. The walls are lined with books,
books bound in calf and russet-colored Russia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
in the middle of the room stands a knee-hole table
both deep and wide. It, too, is covered with books;
but here they lie open, one upon the other, a crowd
of witnesses to the tastes of the owner of the
room. That gracious owner! Addison&#8217;s eyes
grow dim as he thinks of the spare upright figure
seated in the revolving chair; the keen scholarly
face and noble white head. He hears again the
kind, cultivated voice ever ready to answer questions,
to answer them so fully and so beautifully,
with such a tender sympathy for the eager childish
questioner. And then Addison goes down on
his mental knees and thanks his God that as yet
he had brought no look of sorrow into those kind
eyes, but many a look of pride and joy.</p>

<p>Is there not one shelf in that library devoted to
Addison&#8217;s prizes? And the row is lengthening by
leaps and bounds. Yet they wonder at Winchester
why he should be so fond of classics.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE INTERVENTION OF THE DUKE</h3>
</div>


<h4>I<br />

ENTER WIGGINS</h4>

<p>The Reverend Andrew Methven stood at his
study window gazing out to sea. The sea was very
blue, the sands yellow and smooth, but it was not
the sea that the Reverend Andrew saw.</p>

<p>Elgo, on the Fife coast, is growing fashionable.
In summer every house is let, and there are sometimes
as many as fifty bathers at once in the bay.
At Elgo the bathers usually wear blue serge,
adorned it may be by red or white braid. Pale
blue silk with white facings and short sleeves is
not the usual uniform. It impressed the Reverend
Andrew, and consequently he stood and stared.
Moreover, the wearer of this wonderful creation&mdash;he
felt it was a &#8220;creation,&#8221; though he had never
heard the word so used&mdash;came out of the house
next door to the Manse, the house being that of
his most worthy parishioner, Mrs. Urquhart,
Baker and Confectioner, who let her rooms during
the summer months.</p>

<p>Elgo streets are somewhat one-sided, the town
being built upon the cliff with a railing near the
outer edge for the protection of the unwary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>The vision in pale blue silk tripped down the
steep steps cut in the rocks, and ran across the
sands. She was followed by a small thin boy,
whose freckled face was broad and good-natured.
On the sands they took hands and danced into the
water together.</p>

<p>The vision was tall and slim, with wonderful
arms that flashed white in the June sunshine, and
the minister remarked that she could swim magnificently.
The little naked boy splashed after her,
looking like a terrier as he shook the water from
his crop of curly hair.</p>

<p>The minister&#8217;s window was open, and across the
sunlit sands came the sound of a woman&#8217;s voice,
crying: &#8220;Come on, Wiggins, get on my back, and
I&#8217;ll swim with you to the Cock&#8217;s-tail Rocks!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Reverend Andrew swung his telescope into
position; he had the grace to blush as he did so,
but none the less did he eagerly follow that swimmer
by its aid. She did it, there and back; then
she and the small boy ran dripping over the sands
and vanished through Mrs. Urquhart&#8217;s side door.</p>

<p>An hour later the minister (he was the Free
Kirk minister really; there is an Established
Church in Elgo, but as its pews are empty and its
incumbent of small account, he was &#8220;the minister&#8221;
to Elgo) strolled into Mrs. Urquhart&#8217;s shop
to buy cookies. Mrs. Urquhart herself bustled
forward to serve him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve let your rooms, I see, Mrs. Urquhart!
And early in the season, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! I&#8217;ve let my rooms, and to my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
young lady that I was nurse to; you&#8217;ll mind my
telling you of Sir John Penberthy and his bonny
family. Well, Mrs. Burton is just my Miss Mary,
married and widowed too, poor lamb, and she and
Master Wiggins have come all the way from London
to be with me, and it&#8217;s proud I am to have
them!&#8221; Mrs. Urquhart paused breathless.</p>

<p>The minister murmured something sympathetic,
and taking up his bag of cookies strode back to
the Manse. &#8220;Mary, mother of names,&#8221; he thought,
as he turned over the information he had received.
&#8220;Widowed! She doesn&#8217;t wear much mourning
anyway!&#8221; as he thought of the blue silk bathing-dress.
Then he said with a sigh, &#8220;She is very
beautiful!&#8221; and sat him down to write his Sunday
sermon.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he met Wiggins on the beach:
that gentleman was digging while a French <i>bonne</i>
kept guard in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like Elgo?&#8221; asked the minister. He
had a kindly way with children; he was rather
childlike himself, and they knew it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully,&#8221; answered Wiggins, patting his
castle walls, and barely looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been to the sea before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, yes; haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live here,&#8221; said the minister, rather discomposed
by this exceedingly cool child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I did!&#8221; sighed Wiggins. &#8220;I hate Kensington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s London! I&#8217;ve never been there,&#8221;
said the minister simply. &#8220;I wish I had.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a very nice place. There&#8217;s gardens
and busses, and sometimes we ride in a hansom,
and you always have to wear your shoes and generally
gloves, it&#8217;s beastly.&#8221; Wiggins spoke bitterly,
as one who had tasted the hollow shams of
Kensington.</p>

<p>The minister sat down on the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a museum there, and an Art Gallery?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, but you mayn&#8217;t touch anything, and
you have to wear your hat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to object to clothing,&#8221; remarked the
minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; responded this discomposing
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, I can&#8217;t say I do. It&#8217;s warm,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s warm enough in Kensington, if that&#8217;s
what you want!&#8221; and Wiggins turned to dig a
fresh channel from his castle to the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu Wiggins, il faut aller &agrave; la maison pour
le th&eacute;. Faites vos adieux &agrave; M&#8217;sieu le Cur&eacute;!&#8221; and
Madeleine, the pretty French <i>bonne</i>, folded up her
crochet, and rose.</p>

<p>But Wiggins was smitten with deafness, and
waded deeper into the water, with a seraphically
unconscious look.</p>

<p>Madeleine went down to the water&#8217;s edge, where
she discoursed volubly for about five minutes. The
minister sat watching; he wondered why French
people speak so fast, and whether Wiggins understood.
He evidently did, for he answered derisively,
and sat down suddenly in the water. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
he came out, and grinning at the minister, remarked
gleefully as he took his dripping way
homeward:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the third pair to-day, soon shan&#8217;t have
any left to wear. What a rux!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s a London child!&#8221; mused the minister.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine frank lad; I must call upon his
mother.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II<br />

A NEW ATMOSPHERE</h4>

<p>But the days went on, and the minister did not
call. He was a sociable fellow, much beloved by
his fisher folk, and by such summer visitors as
knew him. Elgo was his first &#8220;charge.&#8221; Had he
been small, instead of six-foot-three, he would
doubtless long ago have been dubbed &#8220;The Little
Minister,&#8221; after Mr. Barrie&#8217;s immortal hero, for
he was young as a minister can be.</p>

<p>He did not call on Mrs. Burton because he had
conceived for her an extravagant admiration, or
rather adoration. He met her constantly on the
beach and in the village street, and on these occasions
gravely lifted his hat. Had he followed his
impulse, he would have gone down on his knees
and begged leave to kiss her feet. We do not follow
our impulses in these matters nowadays, and
Mary Burton never wondered why he did not call,
for she thought about him not at all.</p>

<p>She did not go to church that first Sunday, but
played with Wiggins on the beach all the morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Mrs. Urquhart was scandalized and suggested
the Episcopalian church at Pittenweem;
but Mary only put her arms round her old nurse
and laughingly promised to come and sit in her
pew next Sunday.</p>

<p>The minister progressed in his friendship with
Wiggins; while Mary was scouring the country on
her bicycle, Wiggins and his new friend played on
the beach or fished for poddlies from the rocks.</p>

<p>Madeleine with the inevitable crochet sat on the
beach and beamed at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Presbyterian, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked
Wiggins abruptly of the minister one afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a member of the Free Kirk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re Free Kirk, and Madeleine&#8217;s a Roman
Catholic, and mother and me is Pagans!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pagans?&#8221; echoed the minister in astonished
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother says so. It means that you love
the sun, and the sea, and bare feet and meringues
and music-halls and things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pagans, music-halls!&#8221; The minister gazed in
horror at the unconscious but breathless Wiggins.
&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; he asked solemnly, &#8220;that
you do not know anything about our Saviour who
died for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wiggins turned and looked at him with something
of reproachful scorn on his broad freckled
face; then he said slowly: &#8220;Of course, I know,
but we never talk about <i>that</i> to strangers, mother
and me. It is bad form, like the people who give
you tracts in busses.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;I beg your pardon, I misunderstood,&#8221; said
the minister.</p>

<p>They were silent for a few minutes, during
which the minister digested this, to him, new view
of confessing your faith before men.</p>

<p>Although he himself never gave tracts either in
busses or anywhere else, he had certainly in a sort
of hazy fashion considered that to do so was
praiseworthy, if mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s mother!&#8221; announced Wiggins suddenly.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s come and talk to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister scrambled to his feet, and in another
moment he had shaken hands with Mrs. Burton,
and they all sat down on the beach together.</p>

<p>Wiggins did most of the talking, and then it
began to rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come in and have a cup of tea with
Wiggins and me?&#8221; asked Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>The minister felt that no words at all expressed
the rapture with which this proposal filled him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Urquhart&#8217;s parlor looked so different that
afternoon. Many photographs stood on the mantelpiece,
books other than albums or Family
Bibles were scattered on the table, papers and
magazines strewed the horsehair sofa, while on
the mantelpiece among the photographs and the
little vases full of roses were the ends of many
half-smoked cigarettes. Another shock was in
store for the minister.</p>

<p>They had tea; he drank three cups and ate endless
scones in order to prolong the meal. To sit
opposite to Mary and watch her white, heavily
ringed hands flit in and out among the cups as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
made tea was a wonderful thing. To listen to her
as she praised Elgo, and Scotland generally, in her
soft Southern voice was wonderful; but most wonderful
of all was to gaze at her unrebuked, to
drink in the beauty of her face, to note the gracious
line of cheek and chin as she turned her head,
and lose himself in the depths of her eyes, brown
as the trout stream beyond Glen Dynoch. When
at last some small consciousness of material things
awoke in him and he rose to go, Mary reached to
the chimneypiece for a slim tin box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you have a cigarette?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Dear
Mrs. Urquhart forgives my evil habits, and pretends
she thinks that I smoke for asthma. I don&#8217;t
look asthmatical, do I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; faltered the minister. &#8220;I do not
smoke now&mdash;I gave it up after my student days,
just as I gave up drinking anything, for the sake
of my people. I daresay it was useless, but I
thought it was right&mdash;then.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke diffidently, humbly, half expecting a
flash of amused scorn in her, such as he not infrequently
encountered in Wiggins. But Mary held
out her hand, saying softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it was right then, and is now; but
don&#8217;t judge me hardly, for I have no flock to influence.
My boys will smoke, anyhow, when they
are big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is kind of you not to laugh at me,&#8221; he said,
and with that took his leave.</p>

<p>Mary lit her cigarette and smoked thoughtfully
for some time. Wiggins was once more searching
for treasure on his beloved beach. She sat at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
open window and watched the boats come in. Presently
she rang the bell for Mrs. Urquhart. When
that good lady appeared, breathless from her
ascent of the steep little stairs, Mary pushed her
into an armchair and sat down at her feet, with
her head against the old woman&#8217;s knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amuse me, nursey; tell me about your minister.
Where does he come from? How is it that,
without having been anywhere or seen anything,
he is such a perfect gentleman, and why&mdash;oh, why
is he a Free Church minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what for no, my dearie? He&#8217;s an excellent,
well-doing young man. You should hear him
preach; it&#8217;s just wonderfu&#8217;. His father&#8217;s a doctor
near Aberdeen; bein&#8217; douce people they are&mdash;a
large young family, and all doing well. He was at
the college in Edinburgh, and passed very high.
But it&#8217;s no his learning that we care about, it&#8217;s his
kind, friendly ways. He&#8217;d take his turn nursing
a body that&#8217;s sick just like one of the family; and
he&#8217;s just a wonderful way with young men. To
be sure, he&#8217;s young himself&mdash;only just twenty-six&mdash;but
he&#8217;s not a bit bumptious or puffed up, like
many young men. He&#8217;s greatly set up with Master
Wiggins; they&#8217;re grand friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been very kind to Wiggins. I&#8217;ll ask
him to dinner. Will you cook me a very nice dinner,
nursey dear, on Thursday evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll no come then, my dearie, for it&#8217;s prayer-meeting
night. I just wish you&#8217;d go yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been to a prayer-meeting. What&#8217;s
it like? What happens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just beautiful, my dearie; and the gentry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
go too. Mrs. Braid, of Elgo House, she always
goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary made a little face. &#8220;She called upon me
yesterday. I didn&#8217;t find her very exciting. I&#8217;ve
got to dine there to-night, so I suppose I must
dress. You might send Madeleine to do my hair.
Dear nursey, I&#8217;d far rather stay with you than
go to Elgo House.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III<br />

&#8220;ALL SECRET SHADOWS AND MYSTIC SIGHTS&#8221;</h4>

<p>Dinner parties at Elgo House were not, as a
rule, exciting. The conversation generally vibrated
between the harvest prospects and the
game prospects, with somewhat numerous flashes
of silence, during which each guest madly racked
his brain for a fresh topic of conversation, only to
fall back finally upon the weather.</p>

<p>Andrew Methven did not expect to enjoy himself
much on that particular evening. His presence
at Elgo House was something of an anomaly,
for the family were &#8220;established&#8221; by conviction,
yet Mrs. Braid attended the Free Kirk because
she liked Andrew&#8217;s sermons.</p>

<p>He felt rather as though he were poaching on
his neighbor&#8217;s preserves when he went there. He
liked his brother cleric (as he liked most people),
who, if old and somewhat dull, was kindly and
human. So long as his evening pipe and toddy
were forthcoming with regularity the &#8220;established&#8221;
minister recked little if he preached to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
empty benches. Andrew Methven felt the blood
rush to his face as on entering the Braids&#8217; drawing-room
he heard that voice which had been ringing
in his ears ever since his parting with Mary
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Daylight lasts long in the North Country, and
there were no candles needed at Elgo House for
dinner. Mary sat opposite the minister, and had
he been given to cursing he would have cursed the
tall epergne of fruit that hid her from his sight,
especially as the majority of her remarks were
addressed to him.</p>

<p>The only other guests were an elderly colonel
and his wife, who were staying at the hotel. The
colonel, whenever he looked at or spoke to Mary,
seemed by his very atmosphere to ejaculate &#8220;Monstrous
fine woman,&#8221; and Andrew felt an insane
desire to choke him there and then in his own
high white collar.</p>

<p>Dinner over, they all strolled into the garden,
and then that happened which made an epoch in
Andrew Methven&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>When they had all duly admired the roses and
the goodly promise of peaches on the south wall,
someone brought a guitar out of the house and
Mary sat down to sing.</p>

<p>Her dress, some soft transparent blackness over
white, faded into the shadows among which she
sat. Somehow it reminded Andrew of the silver
birch trees in the copse beyond. She bent her
head as she tuned the guitar, and the throb of the
strings seemed an appropriate background to the
sweetness of her profile. Vision and sound became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
indissolubly mixed. Andrew could never
afterward separate Mary&#8217;s face from her voice,
and both were irresistibly a part of the beech
copse seen dimly in the evening light. The whole
making a picture, subtle, detached, vivid; an experience
in which all the senses bore an equal part
and were indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s voice was a big, soft contralto, as unlike
the usual &#8220;drawing-room voice&#8221; as it is possible
to be, and she sang seriously. She gave her message
to the four winds to be carried where they
listed. She sang to the scented night, to the distant
sea, to the flowers and the moonlight: not to
the little handful of human beings, whose chairs
creaked as they sat, and who, saving one, only
realized that she was a beautiful woman who had
a fine voice.</p>

<p>They thanked her when she had finished, all but
Andrew, who, white-faced and dumb, gazed into
the deepening shadows as he stood by Mary&#8217;s
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really most extraordinary to be able to sit
out at night in June in Scotland, is it not?&#8221; said
the colonel&#8217;s wife in his ear. He started, looking
at her stupidly. &#8220;A very absent young man!&#8221; she
said to herself.</p>

<p>Truly he was absent, for he had been in heaven.</p>

<p>Mary, too, was silent, softly beating out a faint
melody on her guitar as it lay across her knees.</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked up at Andrew, saying under
her breath: &#8220;The rest may reason and welcome,
&#8217;tis we musicians know!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;The rest&#8221; did not hear, or hearing did not
understand; but Andrew said: &#8220;Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel&#8217;s voice was heard declaring that it
was &#8220;deucedly chilly,&#8221; and everybody made a
move to go indoors, except Andrew, who, pleading
work, fled down the drive, only to walk for miles
aimlessly in a direction leading further and further
from the Manse.</p>

<p>Had he but known it, that walk was symbolical
of the rest of his life. When he did get home his
rather ancient &#8220;evening shoes&#8221; were quit worn
out.</p>


<h4>IV<br />

THE EDUCATION OF THE MINISTER</h4>

<p>&#8220;The Duke is coming at the end of the month,&#8221;
announced Wiggins to the minister, as they anchored
and fished for poddlies in the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Duke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother; he&#8217;s at school at Leamington; he&#8217;s
going to Eton in three years. He&#8217;s ten, four years
older nor me.&#8221; Wiggins was a model of conciseness
in the way he imparted information.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you call him the Duke?&#8221; asked the
minister in rather an abstracted voice; he was
watching a tall lady on the distant links.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he is one; his name&#8217;s Marmaduke, and
he is a tremenjous Duke; they all say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are <i>they</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, and uncles, and boys, and people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he like you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;Not a bit; he&#8217;s handsome; he&#8217;s exactly like
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister smiled. Was Mary handsome? he
wondered. For many days now he had forgotten
to take her beauty into account. He never compared
her with other women. She was not to him
more beautiful, not more clever, not more kind
than other women; she was simply what that
Frenchman said of his lady&mdash;she was <i>mieux
femme</i>. There was no one else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very fond of your brother?&#8221; asked
the minister, forcing himself to attend to Wiggins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he goes to school,&#8221; replied that gentleman
guardedly. &#8220;He rather bangs me about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Wiggins a family name?&#8221; abruptly demanded
the minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a jokey man,&#8221; said Wiggins admiringly.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s because of my hair they call me
that; my name&#8217;s Tregenna&mdash;&#8216;Tre, Pol, and Pen,&#8217;
you know. Mother&#8217;s Cornish.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Wiggins had a bite, therefore
excitement reigned for the next five minutes, and
even the advent of the Duke was forgotten.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Did Mary Burton know what she was doing
when she admitted this obscure Free Kirk minister
to friendship and intimacy? Did she realize
how contact with her kindness, her simplicity, her
gentlehood, was making him every day more hopelessly
her slave? In after years, when he walked
in darkness, with a hunger that nothing appeased,
Andrew would ask himself this question, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
whichever way he answered it he blessed her. He
no more thought of blaming her than the sailor
thinks of tracing the storm to the evening star.</p>

<p>&#8220;She shall have worship of me,&#8221; he said in those
early days of wonder and happiness. &#8220;She still
has worship of me,&#8221; he said after years of unsatisfied
longing and ceaseless pain.</p>

<p>There was a song that Mary used to sing, a
song he loved, written by a man for whom and for
whose writings in those youthful opinionated days
Andrew felt a hatred that was almost fear. Yet
the song dominated him, and in after years he
would repeat it to himself with a curious fierce
sense of possession.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O brother, the Gods were good to you.</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep, and be glad while the world endures.</div>
<div class="verse">Be well content as the years wear through;</div>
<div class="verse">Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures;</div>
<div class="verse">Give thanks for life, O brother, and death,</div>
<div class="verse">For the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath,</div>
<div class="verse">For gifts she gave you, gracious and few,</div>
<div class="verse">Tears and kisses, that lady of yours.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again across the silence he would hear Mary&#8217;s
voice; again would he see against the evening sky
her delicate pale profile and the little head
weighted with its coils of shadowy hair; accompanying
it all, the soft plash of the waves as they
rolled over the sands beneath her window and the
sharp salt wind which sighed foreboding things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;No! I won&#8217;t sing any more to-night; let us
talk,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>The weather had turned unkindly, a bright fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
flickered on the hearth, while the rain outside
drove and pattered against the rattling windows.
The minister had come in &#8220;for some music&#8221; as
had become his habit during the last weeks, but,
Mary was in no mood to sing, so she laid the guitar
aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me that you intended to criticize my
sermon of yesterday,&#8221; said Andrew deferentially.
&#8220;I gather that you altogether disagree with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary lit a cigarette and smiled at him, her own
indulgent smile, which always softened the severity
of her remarks. &#8220;Yes, I think your view is narrow,
and in some respects unjust. Of course, I
know it is the kind of sermon that is popular;
and it is certainly kind to the novelists to abuse
them from the pulpit&mdash;it increases the sale of their
books so enormously. But that was hardly your
object, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what was my object, unless it
were to deliver a message that I felt had been entrusted
to me. I do feel strongly on this question.
It seems to me so pitiful that people should waste
their time in reading injurious trash, when all the
time there waits in silent patience the great company
of the Immortals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like Schumann&#8217;s view best. He says, &#8216;Reverence
what is old, but have a warm heart also for
what is new.&#8217; Much that is new is true, and beautiful,
and helpful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary leant forward, looking eagerly through a
little cloud of smoke at the minister.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;A great deal is hopelessly
false, and ugly and lowering.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;I think you overrate the influence of bad
books,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;It is only the great books
that live; a meretricious book may have a few
months&#8217; popularity, and then no one reads it any
more, it is forgotten as absolutely as we forget
the smell of decaying cabbage when we have passed
the rubbish heaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you will allow that there is a great
badness as well as a great goodness. Look at
those Frenchmen; you cannot say their work is
good, but it certainly will live, because it is great.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister spoke earnestly. He hated that
she should think him narrow; but he had the courage
of his opinions.</p>

<p>Mary was silent for a minute, then she looked at
him and smiled, saying frankly:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true; but I believe that in all genius
there must be something of goodness. We are all
going to heaven, and De Maupassant is going too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to think they are all going, but it
seems to me some of them have much to answer
for. Influence is an awful responsibility. I believe
it is the one thing for which we shall have
to give the strictest account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary looked grave. &#8220;Do you think that people
always realize when they have influence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not always; they do not certainly realize
the extent of their influence. You, for instance,
were you less noble-minded, might do incalculable
harm, for you never think about the effect you
produce at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t be so seriously complimentary,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;To pose as &#8216;a good influence&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
would be too dreadful! I should feel like
seven curates rolled into one. Confess now,
though, that you always thought a liking for cigarettes
was the sign in a woman of moral obliquity,
now, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andrew blushed. &#8220;I have seen very little, and
known few interesting people,&#8221; he said modestly;
&#8220;none from your world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far we are getting from your sermon on
modern literature; that is what we were going to
talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke as I felt; I daresay I am wrong, but I
can&#8217;t feel wrong yet. It may be that I overestimate
the influence of books; but you see, in my
case, books have been the only great influences I
have known&mdash;until lately,&#8221; he added softly.</p>

<p>Mary looked into the fire in silence for a few
minutes, then she said: &#8220;Never judge a man by
one book any more than you would judge him by
one single act, but be grateful when you come
across any piece of work that you like. It always
seems to me that we render so little gratitude to
the people who give us so much pleasure, and it
must be sad for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw the end of her cigarette into the fire,
and stood up, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must send you away, for it&#8217;s half-past ten,
and we are early folk here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andrew bowed over the fair kind hand, and
went back to his study at the Manse. Here there
was no fire, no genial smell of smoke, everything
was orderly, cold, and dull. Andrew sat down by
his writing-table, and laid his head down on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
arms. Truly the thoughts of youth are long, long
thoughts.</p>

<p>A sleepless night is interminable at six-and-twenty.
At forty, one takes it as something that
has to be got through, probably with the aid of
chloral.</p>


<h4>V<br />

MARY</h4>

<p>There are people who can stir up the worst that
is in us; that strange, inherent moral obliquity,
which few are so happy as to be without, but
which most of us bury under our strivings after
things lovely and of good report. When success
crowns the efforts of these moral dredgers, and
they are generally as successful as they are persevering,
they stand aside, apparently aghast, and
proceed to cry &#8220;shame&#8221; noisily upon our depravity.
These are they who &#8220;compound for sins they
are inclined to&#8221; by damning, not &#8220;those they have
no mind to,&#8221; but such sins as at the time they
happen to be tired of.</p>

<p>There are others, thank God for it, with whom
intercourse is a sort of festival, not merely because
their own outlook is so generous and kindly,
but because they rouse what is best in one&#8217;s self.
One leaves such friends&mdash;they are friends if you
have met them once&mdash;strong and gay and full of
belief in the infinite possibilities of life.</p>

<p>Mary Burton was of this latter class. She made
no great sacrifices, she enjoyed her life thoroughly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
taking eagerly all pleasure that came in her way;
but her temper was generous, her mind broad, and
because she herself could not understand meanness,
she never suspected others. She was seldom
disappointed. It is the narrow little soul who so
constantly encounters other narrow souls. The
simple, kindly people meet with simplicity and
kindness.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that their outlook was so similar
proved the great bond between Mary and the
minister of Elgo. Their upbringing and environment
were so absolutely dissimilar, their views of
life so unlike, yet beyond it all and through it all
sounded the same note, dominating the discords
and making harmony.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such a lovable good fellow,&#8221; Mary would
say to herself. &#8220;One forgives him for always
using shall and will in the wrong places, and for
denying himself everything that some people think
makes life endurable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is so kind and gracious, so dignified without
being haughty, so absolute an aristocrat in all
her beautiful ways; she is a princess. What does
it matter if she does smoke and read French
novels? If she does it, it must be right for her.&#8221;
So argued the minister, though he kept his own
sturdy Scottish opinion with regard to the unwholesomeness
for ordinary digestions of some of
the literature which Mary affected.</p>

<p>So the days went on and these two lovable good
people saw more and more of one another, worshipper
and worshipped, and although the parties
mainly concerned preserved the ostrich-like blindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of people in their condition, the &#8220;summer
visitors&#8221; of Elgo and the parish itself took a lively
interest in their doings and waited with a somewhat
impatient expectation of the climax.</p>

<p>One thing struck Andrew Methven as curious:
in all their many conversations Mary had never
mentioned her husband. She talked frankly of her
father and her brothers, of the people she had met
in India, and of those she was in the habit of meeting
in London, but of her husband, never. Andrew
found himself wondering what manner of
man Captain Burton had been; but it never occurred
to him to try to find out anything about
Mary or her surroundings. He never spoke of her
to anyone, and winced if anyone spoke of her to
him. About his own family and his own &#8220;past,&#8221;
if so uneventful life can be said to have a past, he
was most frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;My people are what you would call &#8216;nice
middle-class&#8217; people, perhaps a little fonder of
books than their sort are in England, but you have
never met anybody of that kind except me, and
you would not find them congenial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary made a little face. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I never
spoke of anybody as a &#8216;nice middle-class person,&#8217;
I shouldn&#8217;t be such a snob, and I have met all sorts
of people&mdash;people you would think Bohemian and
terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to meet literary people,&#8221; said
Andrew wistfully, &#8220;but I suppose I never shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will, and you won&#8217;t find them any
more interesting than your Fifeshire fisher folk.
Epigrams pall upon you when they form the staple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
commodity of conversation. The somewhat dingy
journalist, who has a trick of smart talking and
who poses to himself as everything he is not, is
just as great a bore as the respectable city clerk
who lives at Hornsey and expatiates upon its advantages.
You must not mistake cleverness for
genius. The one is often merely the result of environment
and atmosphere. The other nearly
always appears in unlikely and seemingly impossible
places. You know what Swinburne says:
&#8216;There is only one thing we may reverence, and
that is genius. There is only one thing we may
worship, and that is goodness.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Andrew thoughtfully,
&#8220;that you reverse it. You reverence goodness
and worship genius!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do, certainly and perhaps fortunately,
the one is much rarer than the other. The
best things in life are the commonest. There are
flowers, and children, and love, and friendship
for everybody, if they will have them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And death and disillusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, turning pessimist, <i>Padre mio</i>! This will
never do. You are too serious&mdash;far too serious.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Mary shivered, but she did not answer. She
called to Wiggins to come out of the water, for it
was growing cold.</p>

<p>The minister scourged himself for four hours
afterward, for he noticed that she was pale, and
that there were shadows under her brown eyes.
What had he said?</p>


<h4>VI<br />

MARY&#8217;S HUSBAND</h4>

<p>Mary had gone to play golf at St. Andrews. The
minister called on Mrs. Urquhart anent some
parish matters and she detained him, rather
against his will, to talk of Mary and her perfections.
She never spoke of her except as &#8220;My Miss
Mary,&#8221; and it was apt to bewilder the uninitiated.
Suddenly she asked the minister:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she ever talk to you of the wee girlie
who was killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What wee girlie? Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, it was just an awful thing. Sit down, Mr.
Methven, and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mrs. Urquhart, do you think if it is so
sad, and if she&mdash;Mrs. Burton never told me herself&mdash;that
she would like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuts, sir! It&#8217;s nothing disgraceful; it&#8217;s just
fearfully sad. Ye can only admire her the more
for her courage. Well, as I was saying, she had a
wee girlie just three years old when they all came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
home from India on long leave. Master Wiggins
was the baby, and Miss Molly was the bonniest
creature you ever saw. The Captain&mdash;a fine, free-handed
gentleman he was, if a wee thing wild&mdash;was
just wrapped up in her, the boys were nowhere;
and he would aye go and fetch her out o&#8217;
her cot every evening after dinner and play, and
nothing Miss Mary could say would stop him.
Well, that August they had taken a house down in
Cornwall to be near Miss Mary&#8217;s father. And one
evening Miss Mary had gone to dine with an old
aunt some miles off, and the Captain and a gentleman
staying dined alone. It is thought that the
Captain may have taken rather much champagne&mdash;he
did whiles&mdash;but anyway he went and got Miss
Molly out of bed and wrapped her in a blanket
and carried her out-of-doors. It was no use for
the nurse to say anything&mdash;he was a masterful
gentleman, and brooked no interference. The
other gentleman had gone to write letters in the
study. Well, Miss Mary came home about ten, and
of course went straight up to the night nursery.
The little boys were both in bed asleep, but Miss
Molly&#8217;s cot was empty, and the nurse told her the
Captain had not brought her up to bed yet. Miss
Mary was rather indignant, for she thought it so
bad for the child, and went down to fetch her.
But the Captain was not in the study, and the
other gentleman had not seen him since dinner.
He seemed rather alarmed when he heard that
Miss Molly was missing, and everybody went out
to search the garden, for they were nowhere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the house. They sought and sought, and nothing
could they find. Then Miss Mary sent the grooms
out with lanterns, and she and the gentleman took
the carriage lamps and went down to the foot of
the garden where the cliff went sharp down to
the sea. There was a steep path cut in the cliff,
and down this they went. At the bottom, lying on
the hard rock, they found the Captain, with Miss
Molly in his arms quite dead, and his back was
broken. He lived for three days, and he died
with his hand in my dear lady&#8217;s. She never spoke
one word of reproach; but he didn&#8217;t need it, poor
man; his grief was terrible to see, they say. He
must have stumbled and fallen sheer over. It&#8217;s
six years ago now; my young lady was only three-and-twenty.
Eh, it was a heavy sorrow for a
young thing like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Urquhart&#8217;s voice broke, and she stopped.
The minister was very white, he held out his hand
to her, but did not speak. The Scotch understand
each other. They have realized this great truth&mdash;that
some things are unsayable. The minister
held good Mrs. Urquhart&#8217;s hand in both his for
two silent minutes, then he took his hat and went
his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a grand young man yon!&#8221; said Mrs.
Urquhart to herself, &#8220;he&#8217;ll make it up till her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the young man in question felt that he was
further off than ever from his divinity. The wall
of unshared experience is high and impassable;
we may break it down in places, but it stretches its
gaunt length along life&#8217;s highway and we each of
us must keep to our own side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>


<h4>VII<br />

&#8220;BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA&#8221;</h4>

<p>&#8220;I rather like that minister person,&#8221; said the
Duke to Wiggins in his most patronizing voice,
&#8220;he seems a decent chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; ejaculated Wiggins with immense conviction;
&#8220;he&#8217;s a splendid chap&mdash;a bit Scotchy, you
know, but he&#8217;s awfully kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mater likes him too, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. He&#8217;s always with us, you see, living
next door and that. He knows all the best places
to fish, and he can build the most splendid castles
with moats and secret passages and no end!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke turned his handsome head and smiled
indulgently at Wiggins. &#8220;I bet he can&#8217;t shoot or
play cricket much, or ride anything but a bike.
You can&#8217;t remember father, Wiggins; he was a
soldier, you know, and he used to say: &#8216;Ride
straight, shoot straight, and speak the truth, and
you&#8217;ll be a gentleman, sonny.&#8217; An officer and a
gentleman. I remember though it&#8217;s so long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke&#8217;s eyes grew soft. He had loved that
big handsome father of his with the uncomprehending,
admiring love of a little-noticed child.
The little daughter had been everything to Captain
Burton, yet the Duke cherished his memory and
rendered him a devotion greater than that he gave
to the mother who understood him; a devotion
which Mary took care should never be disturbed
by any word of hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>As Captain Burton lay dying he had lifted his
weak arms and dragged her head down close to his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell the boys,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Let
them think the best of me. Duke is a fine chap;
he&#8217;ll make it up to you. I&#8217;ve been a beast and a
fool, but I always loved you, Mary. Promise you
won&#8217;t tell the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mary promised.</p>

<p>The Duke was a singularly handsome boy, with
grave, beautiful manners. He never looked untidy
or slovenly. Like his mother, he wore his clothes
in such a way that he always seemed better and
more suitably dressed than other people. He was
rather a silent person, but gave one the impression
that he was silent from choice, not because he had
nothing to say.</p>

<p>He was very unmistakably a member of the
&#8220;classes,&#8221; and though exceedingly urbane and
gracious to what he was pleased to call mentally
his &#8220;inferiors,&#8221; he was so because it would be ungentlemanly
to be otherwise.</p>

<p>He would gravely assist a fishwife to raise her
heavy creel to her shoulders, and lift his cap to
her with a Hyde Park flourish when she started on
her way. But he did so because he considered it
the duty of a gentleman to assist women&mdash;not as
Wiggins would have done, from a friendly interest
in that particular fishwife. Slim, tall, and aristocratic,
with oval face, straight nose, and big brown
eyes, the Duke was a noticeable boy anywhere, and
Mary was immensely proud of him.</p>

<p>He was good at most games, and quick to learn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
He ferreted out a pony in the next village and
rode about the country, to the admiration of the
natives. He golfed on the gentlemen&#8217;s links and
played a very good game for his age. He went
fishing with the minister and Wiggins, and he
bicycled with his mother.</p>

<p>Since the advent of her eldest boy, it seemed to
the minister that there was a certain remoteness
about Mary. Certainly her time was very much
taken up. The Duke required other amusements
than those afforded by the beach, a bucket, and a
wooden spade. He expected and received the constant
companionship of his mother. On several
occasions the minister was allowed to join their
bicycling expeditions. To watch Mary bicycle was
a never-ending wonder to him. She never seemed
to go fast; it was only when you rode after her
that you found she was hard to catch. The minister
always wondered why her skirts never seemed
to bunch and blow as did those of other women.
He knew nothing of tailors as a great artistic
power, but he was keenly alive to the result of
their labors in the grace and symmetry of her
appearance.</p>

<p>The Duke also was a constant surprise, but for
him the minister&#8217;s frank admiration was tempered
by a subtle but searching discomfort in his society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said ruefully one day to
Mary, &#8220;that the Duke makes me conscious of my
boots, and the lack of trees to keep them on? I
never thought of it before, but I am sure now that
it has been a serious omission.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;The Duke is the descendant of generations of
dandies, and has all the faults and the good qualities
that belong to the class. In many respects the
dandy is a limited person both for good and evil;
certain social solecisms are, of course, impossible
to him, but he generally is lacking in imagination.
The Duke, for instance, is less sympathetic than
Wiggins, but he is harder on himself also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can a woman be a dandy?&#8221; inquired the minister
in a tone of grave interest.</p>

<p>Mary laughed. &#8220;Every woman of the world is
more or less a dandy, but she takes the position
less seriously than does a man. If in some directions
our sense of proportion is undeveloped, it
has arrived at perfection in matters of clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I can only wear one sort of clothes;
it saves so much trouble, and I should be certain
to get the wrong ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you would. Be thankful for your uniform;
it is becoming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very hot and uncomfortable in summer.
I almost feel I could echo Wiggins in his abuse of
clothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wear flannels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do for tennis, but one can&#8217;t call on one&#8217;s
parishioners in flannels; they&#8217;d think it casual
and disrespectful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they would. Well, you must dree your
weird!&#8221; Mary spoke lightly, but for the minister
her last words had an ominous sound.</p>

<p>Presently they all halted &#8220;to give the bicycles
a feed&#8221; as the Duke put it&mdash;the fact being that
they had arrived at the foot of what was for Fife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
a very steep hill. The day was hot, and they had
six more miles to do before they reached the East
Neuk, whither they were escorting the Duke.
Grass and the shade of trees looked inviting.
Mary and the minister decided to rest, but the
energetic Duke went off on an exploring expedition
in an adjacent wood.</p>

<p>The minister and Mary sat quite silent for some
minutes; then Mary said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Urquhart told you of my great trouble
six years ago. I am glad. I wanted you to know,
and I wanted you to know that I am glad.&#8221; Her
voice was very soft, her eyes were bent on the
grass.</p>

<p>Andrew Methven looked at her but he did not
speak.</p>

<p>She looked up a little surprised, and saw his
face working strangely. She understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to say anything,&#8221; she said, laying
her hand on his arm. &#8220;You are sorry. You are
a good friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow the touch of the little gloved hand on
his arm made the minister lose his head. He did
not attempt to hold it in his own&mdash;his reverence
for her was too great for that&mdash;but he told her
simply and forcibly what he felt for her. She did
not try to stop him. The sunshine and the summer
had got into her blood, and this worship that was
offered to her was sweet and precious. There was
nothing ridiculous in it, nothing impossible. He
did not ask her to be his wife; in his wildest dreams
of happiness he had never reckoned on the possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
of that. He did not ask to be anything to
her; all he told her was what she was to him.</p>

<p>And in the very middle of it all the Duke came
back, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are to get to the East Neuk by teatime,
we&#8217;d better be off; it&#8217;s four already.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they rode off, and very silent companions the
Duke found them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Seven years before in Simla, Mary had had a
great success. She had been made much of, and
had enjoyed it. Many men had made love to her,
and she had enjoyed it. A beautiful, healthy girl
accepts admiration as her natural right.</p>

<p>But the men who made love to her did not enjoy
it, for many of them had the misfortune to be
serious, and although Mary accepted their flowers
and their compliments and their devotion in her
own gay, gracious fashion, she gave nothing in
return but that gay graciousness and the privilege
of her society.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she were in love with that card-playing,
drinking fool, her husband, I could understand it,&#8221;
said Major Molyneux of the 42nd; &#8220;but she isn&#8217;t
in love with him, not a bit; and yet she&#8217;s an icicle
to every other chap. It&#8217;s not as if she were one of
those cold, saint-in-a-shrine sort of women; she&#8217;s
as human as she can be. She&#8217;s no fool, either.
What, in heaven&#8217;s name, made her marry her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calm yourself, my dear Molly! Calm yourself,&#8221;
answered the elderly civilian to whom he
was unburdening himself. &#8220;You have yet to learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
that the selective faculty is latest of development
in women. Most women, especially if they are
pretty, marry before it has developed at all. If
they are good as well as pretty, they take care it
shan&#8217;t develop afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burton hasn&#8217;t even the grace to be jealous; he
lets her do just what she pleases. He&#8217;s so mighty
conceited that he never seems to think she may
come across a man capable of understanding her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commissioner smiled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think much
of Burton&#8217;s intellectual capacity, but I do give
him credit for this&mdash;he understands his wife, and
because he understands her, he trusts her absolutely.
It&#8217;s no use, my dear boy, Simla will never
have the pleasure of discussing Mrs. Burton in
connection with any sort of scandal; she&#8217;s not that
kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>The commissioner was right. Her husband
never had reason to find fault with Mary, and since
his death she had devoted herself to her boys and
to the cultivation of her mind. She took it as a
matter of course that men should fall in love with
her; they always did. But her experience did not
make her eager to investigate further the realms
of marriage.</p>

<p>Men made love to her because they wanted to
possess her. She was so tired of hearing, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you understand? I want you for myself, for my
very own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary understood, but as yet she had felt no
desire to belong to anybody in that exclusive
fashion.</p>

<p>Andrew Methven touched her. Here at last was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
the Princely Giver she had dreamed of, as women
will dream, the man ready to give everything, asking
only for leave to lay his homage at her feet,
nothing more.</p>

<p>When she had first met him, she set him down
as one of those who are destined &#8220;to do something.&#8221;
It was not his fate to remain an obscure
Free Kirk minister, of that she was sure. The
more she saw of him the more she felt the reality
of the strange power that lay behind his apparently
commonplace views of men and things. &#8220;It
is there,&#8221; she said to herself exultingly, and now
that he had made love to her in this strange, unusual
way, she was seized with a passionate desire
to take this man into her life, and help him to
give form and substance to that latent force of
his.</p>

<p>So Mary dreamed dreams while she listened to
the minister as he discoursed upon the historical
interests of the East Neuk; as they rode home
swiftly and for the most part silently; as, the
Duke having gone to bed, she sat at the open window
and watched the moonlight on the sea.</p>

<p>Then she went and looked at the boys in their
two little straight beds side by side. As she bent
over the Duke he smiled, and threw his arm round
her neck, murmuring sleepily, &#8220;Dear mater.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shading the candle with her hand, she looked
long and greedily at the sleeping children, and, like
all women at such moments, the triumphant sense
of possession swamped every other feeling.</p>

<p>As she reached her own room and stood before
her glass, she looked into the reflected eyes, saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
&#8220;Take ship, for happiness is somewhere to
be had!&#8221;</p>


<h4>VIII<br />

THE COLONEL INTERFERES</h4>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little Burton. I&#8217;ll ask him if it&#8217;s true,&#8221;
ejaculated Colonel Colquhoun, as he noticed three
or four small red-coated figures coming down the
long slope at the far end of the gentlemen&#8217;s links.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not the child; I would not ask the child if
I were you, Colquhoun.&#8221; Mr. Braid spoke earnestly,
laying his hand on the colonel&#8217;s arm to detain
him. &#8220;He may know nothing about it, you know,
there may be nothing to know. In any case I
wouldn&#8217;t ask the boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Colonel Colquhoun had just made an inferior
drive, he was in a bad temper as are many
people during the royal and ancient game, so he
bustled off, ignoring his friend&#8217;s remonstrance,
toward the putting-green where the Duke was triumphantly
holing in after a specially brilliant
placing of his ball.</p>

<p>The caddie shouldered the colonel&#8217;s clubs, and
Mr. Braid followed more slowly. He felt a curious
disinclination to join the little group on the
putting-green. His own lad&mdash;just home from
Fettes&mdash;was one of the players; he had said kind
things of the pluck and perseverance of little Burton.
Mr. Braid&#8217;s heart was tender, and he himself
had not forgotten the moment when he first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
heard of a possible stepfather. He walked more
and more slowly.</p>

<p>The hole that the Duke and his friends were
playing was the last on the links; the boyish figures
were outlined sharply against the sky. Mr. Braid
saw the Duke lift his cap as the colonel came up.
He could not hear what passed, but he saw the
four boys turn, and one after another tee their
balls and drive. The colonel was left alone on the
putting-green, where his ball was not. The caddie
stood grinning, and the colonel cuffed his ears,
declaring that the young ruffian had stolen his
ball.</p>

<p>Mr. Braid waited in patience till the ball was
discovered in some distant bents, but the colonel
did not again mention little Burton or his mother.</p>

<p>The Duke was playing abominably. Halfway
home he said: &#8220;Braid, would you think me an
awful cad if I break up the foursome? I can&#8217;t play
a hang.&#8221; The child&#8217;s lips were quivering, and his
sunburnt cheeks looked white under the tan.</p>

<p>Braid put his arm round his shoulders affectionately.
&#8220;You go home, old chap. You&#8217;re hipped,
but never mind that old beast Colquhoun, he&#8217;s
always making mischief. Don&#8217;t you notice him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;much, did I?&#8221; the Duke asked anxiously.
&#8220;I hope I didn&#8217;t&mdash;show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you&mdash;not a bit. Here, scoot! I&#8217;ll bring
your clubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke broke into a run, and regardless of
the enraged &#8220;fores&#8221; which sounded on every side,
made straight across the links to the rocky shore.
There he would be alone&mdash;alone with this terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
possibility that flashed its lurid light across his
path.</p>

<p>Once behind the rocks he sat down and sobbed,
even as he did so wondering when he had cried
before. The Duke did not &#8220;blub&#8221;&mdash;never&mdash;he
considered tears unworthy of a man, &#8220;of an officer
and a gentleman,&#8221; had not the father whose
memory he adored once said to him: &#8220;Curse if
you like, old man, but never cry.&#8221; So the Duke
never cried, though his language on occasions
would have surprised his mother by its forcible
variety. Before ladies, though, &#8220;gentlemen do
not swear,&#8221; so Mary remained in blissful ignorance
of her son&#8217;s proficiency in certain forms of
objurgation.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Duke sobbed, great tearing,
dreadful sobs that racked his slender body with a
pain that was almost physical.</p>

<p>The colonel had done his work. As he walked
across the green to enlighten Duke, he had said to
himself: &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it hot for Mrs. Burton,
haughty minx; the boy&#8217;s a tartar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary had found it necessary to snub the colonel
on more than one occasion; so he no longer called
her &#8220;a monstrous fine woman.&#8221; A fancied slight
rankles in the mean and narrow soul; revenge is
doubly sweet if one near and dear to the offender
can be made the instrument of punishment.</p>

<p>The Duke sat behind the rocks and sobbed until
he felt sick and stupid. Had he not heard of that
horrible institution called a stepfather? Had he
not read only last holidays a book called &#8220;David<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Copperfield,&#8221; wherein the iniquities of such an one
were set forth with terrible distinctness.</p>

<p>He was not a religious child. Mary was not
dogmatic in her teaching, she influenced more by
her example and her mental attitude than by conscious
effort. Yet here and now the boy felt that
circumstances were too strong for him, and he
prayed in a hopeless, muddled fashion that if his
mother did this thing, God would take him to join
the father she seemed to have forgotten.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that children never come
face to face with despair. They do, more often
than the superior, omniscient grown-ups themselves.
There is a finality about every sorrow for
children, they cannot realize that such pain as
they feel <i>can</i> pass; they do not believe it. That
saddest of all poets must have thought of sorrowing
children when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">We are most hopeless, who had once most hope,</div>
<div class="verse">And most beliefless, who had most believed.</div>
</div></div>

<p>What matter if the grief be short, its poignancy
while it lasts is none the less acute.</p>

<p>The Duke stopped crying, and looked at the bare
wall of rock before him with hopeless, unseeing
eyes. Then as he prayed, a great wave of tenderness,
of longing for his mother, broke over his
child soul, and he got up. Scrambling over the
great boulder he had hidden behind, he set off to
run home. If this amazing, this shameful news
were true, he would set a seal on his misery, and
uncertainty would be at an end. If it were false,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
the Duke set his teeth as he thought of the colonel,
then he squared his shoulders and dropped into
the swinging run which made him such an admirable
hare at &#8220;hare and hounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran by the beach, a good three miles, and
burst into their little sitting-room, tear-stained
and breathless, just as Mary had arranged her
writing-board on her knee.</p>

<p>She looked up in astonishment at his somewhat
noisy entrance. He still wore his cap in the room,
before her, and his face was dirty. Who had seen
the Duke with a dirty face since he arrived at
years of discretion?</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling boy, what has happened? Is it
Wiggins? Is he hurt?&#8221; Mary stood up in her
excitement, and the paper and envelopes were
scattered about the floor.</p>

<p>The Duke only looked at her, his lips trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak, Duke, what is it? Don&#8217;t keep me in
suspense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is hurt, mother, except me, and I&#8217;m
only hurt in my heart.&#8221; The tears ran down his
cheeks as he spoke. &#8220;Mother, is it true&mdash;are you
going to marry Mr. Methven? Oh, say it isn&#8217;t
true. It&#8217;s so dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary drew the boy to her, and sitting down she
took him on her knee. He buried his dirty face in
her neck and sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest, who has said that I am going to
marry Mr. Methven? Surely you do not suspect
me of telling people&mdash;other people&mdash;before I
would tell you such a thing as that! Oh, Duke, I
thought you trusted me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;But, mother, you might not have <i>told</i> them,
they might have guessed, and it&#8217;s not the not knowing
that I mind, it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;Mr. Methven!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Duke, did it never strike you as possible
that I might marry again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never! Never! You belong to Wiggins and
me&mdash;and father. Have you forgotten father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sonny, no. I have not forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, say it isn&#8217;t true, say it isn&#8217;t true,
or I shall die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary folded the boy closer in her arms. &#8220;It is
not true, dear. Mr. Methven has not even asked
me to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke she remembered her own words as
she looked into the glass the night before. Her
face grew very sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he did ask you, mother, you would say
no? You would say no?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke&#8217;s voice, husky with long crying, was
very pathetic.</p>

<p>Mary leaned back in her chair and closed her
eyes. She held her boy very close, and her breath
came quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will ask me, dear, but if he
does, I must say no, for his sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke sat up and gazed at his mother in
absolute amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;For his sake,&#8221; he repeated in a hushed, almost
frightened voice. &#8220;Do you want to marry him,
mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not matter much what I want to do, my
little son; it&#8217;s what I must <i>not</i> do that we have to
do with. I shall not marry Mr. Methven. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
day when you are a man you will realize what I
have given up for you&mdash;and for him!&#8221; And Mary
fell a-weeping with her boy clasped in her arms.</p>

<p>The Duke felt her hot tears on his short-cropped
hair, and he trembled; then, releasing himself from
his mother&#8217;s arms, got off her knee and stood beside
her, very pale and grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;if you want to
marry this&mdash;gentleman&mdash;if it will make you happier,
you shall. Do you hear, darling? You
shall.&#8221; And throwing himself into his mother&#8217;s
arms, they cried together. When it came to the
point, he found that he loved his mother better&mdash;than
himself.</p>

<p>Presently Mary began to laugh. &#8220;Oh, Duke,
Duke, how funny you are! You talk as if I were
a little girl, as if&mdash;but it doesn&#8217;t matter&mdash;some
day you will understand.... It&#8217;s not going to
happen, Duke dear. It&#8217;s been a storm in a teacup.
You must never listen to what ignorant
people say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I contradict them, politely?&#8221; asked the
Duke eagerly, with an immense relief shining in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, if anyone has the impertinence to
speak of such a thing again. It is an insult to Mr.
Methven and to me. Oh, Duke, there&#8217;s somebody
coming upstairs. Quick, go and say I&#8217;ve got a
headache and can&#8217;t see people.&#8221;</p>

<p>It flashed across the boy&#8217;s mind that he was
not very presentable either. However, the staircase
was dark, and he shut the sitting-room door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
behind him. A tall, black-coated figure was ascending
the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother can&#8217;t see anyone to-day, Mr. Methven;
she&#8217;s got a headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as he spoke the door at the top of the
stairs opened, and Mary said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see Mr. Methven, sonny, but ask Mrs.
Urquhart to say I am engaged if anyone else
calls.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sitting-room door closed behind the minister
and Mary. The Duke went to his own room
to wash his face, and to ponder over his mother&#8217;s
words.</p>


<h4>IX<br />

VALE</h4>

<p>Somebody has said that women have no sense
of humor. It is one of those knock-me-down assertions
that provoke argument. The sense of humor
is so blessed a gift, it were unjust indeed to
deny its benefits to the larger half of humanity.
The gods had bestowed it with no niggardly hand
upon Mary. It had stood her in good stead during
many a crisis; its divine attribute did not desert
her now.</p>

<p>There was a poetic justice in the appearance of
Andrew Methven at that particular moment that
appealed to her sense of artistic inevitability; and
as Andrew shut the door behind him, though the
tears shone wet upon her cheeks, she laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;I am sorry you have a headache,&#8221; began Andrew
lamely. &#8220;Shall I go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sit down; I want to talk to you. I&#8217;ve just
been through a somewhat trying scene with the
Duke, and I long that somebody should horsewhip
Colonel Colquhoun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t possess a horsewhip, but I have a good
stout stick.&#8221; The minister&#8217;s manner was most unclerical
as his grasp tightened on the weapon in
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not even ask what he has done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has annoyed you&mdash;that is quite enough;
but I wish he was a younger man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not young enough to thrash, and he is
not quite old enough to ignore; all the same, we
shall have to ignore him. But, you Quixotic person,
would you really thrash a man because I asked
you to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you asked me to thrash a man, I should know
he well deserved thrashing, and I&mdash;should enjoy
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re more man than minister, after all,&#8221;
said Mary, more to herself than to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better man, better minister. Do you think I
could have had any sort of influence over my colliers
at Cowdenbeath if I couldn&#8217;t fight? I can&#8217;t
fence, but I can box. I&#8217;ll teach the Duke, if you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask me what Colonel Colquhoun
has done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you want to tell me, you will tell
me; and if it is unpleasant to you to tell me, why
should you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s as unpleasant as it is necessary I should
tell you, because we must both publicly contradict
a foolish report that has got spread abroad in
Elgo to the effect that we are to be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary did not blush as she spoke, but the minister
crimsoned to the roots of his hair. &#8220;I am
too sorry you should have been subjected to this
annoyance. You know what my feeling for you
is; you also know that I have not the right to ask
a fisher lass to marry me. I am nothing, and have
nothing; but you have let me lay my great love at
your feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary made a little sound, half sob, half laugh,
and held out her hands to him in a helpless, unseeing
way that went to his heart. He caught them
in his own, and looking into the dear face with
purple shadows painted by tears under the eyes,
he knew that she, too, cared.</p>

<p>What does it avail to tell in words how these
two plighted their troth, that was to be ever unfulfilled?
The tenderest and truest of lovers have
generally small literary value.</p>

<p>For half an hour they went to heaven together.</p>

<p>Then they faced realities, and Andrew asked:
&#8220;Will you write to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. &#8220;No; if we write we
shall simply waste our lives in everlasting watching
for the postman. We are very human, you and
I, and how can we hope to be better and wiser than
other people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hard,&#8221; murmured Andrew. &#8220;I can
find no comfort in virtuous soliloquy. A letter
would be something tangible.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;No, I am not hard; but I am old who once was
young, and I know. As it is we shall have a perfect
and unspoiled memory, full of tenderness and
grace and poetry; but if we write we shall be
miserable, ever unsatisfied, hanging, like Mahomet&#8217;s
coffin, between heaven and earth. No; let
us keep this sweet experience untarnished by impotent
tears and regrets.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three days after, Mary and her boys had joined
some of the numerous uncles at a shooting-box
near Kingussie. The Duke was very happy; but
Wiggins missed his beloved sea. &#8220;I think my minister
must miss me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I miss him so
very much; he&#8217;s such a kind man.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">JEAN, A PORTRAIT</h3>
</div>


<p>She was remarkable in the first place because
she never rode in a perambulator like other children;
either she walked&mdash;on bare, shapely, pink
feet&mdash;or her own personal attendant, Elspeth (a
very tall woman indeed), carried her in a plaid
slung over one of her broad shoulders. Elspeth
despised the &#8220;bit barrows&#8221; of the other nurses,
and was quite strong enough to have carried Jean&#8217;s
mother as well as Jean. &#8220;She will go barefoot,&#8221;
Elspeth would say, &#8220;till she iss seven, and when
she iss a woman she will walk like a queen, and
not like a hen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean, if possible, went bareheaded as well as
&#8220;barefoot,&#8221; and perhaps that is the reason why
her hair is so abundant, so curly, so full of golden
light that in the sunshine it almost makes you
blink. Moreover, her eyes are big and blue. Sunshine
and rain, and kind fresh winds have tinted
her face with the loveliest warm browns and
pinks; she is not yet five years old, and she can
dance the sword dance! It is really a great sight
to see Jean&#8217;s pink feet twinkling in and out between
two unsheathed swords of her father&#8217;s, and
he is a proud man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Yet there never was such a &#8220;girly&#8221; girl as Jean.</p>

<p>She has an enormous family of dolls&mdash;for her
adorers all bring dolls, and <i>they</i> are as the sands
of the sea in number&mdash;she takes a motherly interest
in them all, both dolls and adorers, but her
inseparable companion is one &#8220;Tammy,&#8221; an ancient
and dirty-faced rag soldier; with arms and
legs resembling elongated sausages, a square
body, no feet, and a head shaped like a breakfast
&#8220;bap.&#8221; Not an attractive personality to the uninitiated,
but he and Jean were as Ruth and Naomi.
It is something of a sorrow to her that the exigencies
of Tammy&#8217;s figure do not admit of a kilt,
just as she puzzled all last summer in sorrowful
surprise that her father never once donned the
uniform she so admires.</p>

<p>Jean&#8217;s people live at a house on the Terrace,
which has at the back a shady old-fashioned garden
with a big square lawn in the centre. There
Jean&#8217;s brothers, Colin and Andrew, played cricket,
while Jean fielded or drilled her dolls under the
trees. In the evening, after dinner, there would
be a sound of men&#8217;s voices and an occasional
thrum of the banjo under those same trees, and a
cheerful clink of glasses, while men with brown
faces and trim, well-set heads laughed and rejoiced
in a coolness that concealed no malaria.</p>

<p>Jean&#8217;s father had a reprehensible habit of bringing
her, wrapped in a blanket, out into the garden
at ten o&#8217;clock at night, when she would be handed
about from knee to knee like a superior sort of
refreshment. To be fetched out of bed in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
fashion would have been upsetting to some children,
but Jean, with an adorable sleepy smile,
would make herself agreeable for half an hour or
so, and when carried back and tucked into bed&mdash;always
by her father&mdash;fell asleep again directly,
and never seemed a scrap the worse. On such
occasions she was always expected to sing. She
never sang anything but Scottish songs&mdash;mournful
or martial, mostly Jacobite, and her repertory
was enormous. While other children were learning
&#8220;Little Jack Horner,&#8221; or &#8220;Hey diddle diddle!&#8221;
Jean, thanks to Elspeth, learned &#8220;Hey
Johnny Cope,&#8221; or &#8220;Cam&#8217; ye by Athol,&#8221; and her
voice was as the voice of Katherine of France,
&#8220;broken music,&#8221; for her voice was music, and her
English broken. Sometimes a belated passer-by
would wait outside to listen in wonder to someone
singing in the clearest baby voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sing Hey, my bra&#8217; John Hielandman,</div>
<div class="verse">Sing Ho, my bra&#8217; John Hielandman,</div>
</div></div>

<p>and at the end of each refrain she always kissed
her father, for there was no one in the world to
match with him in Jean&#8217;s eyes. She absolutely
declined to sing the last verse after that day upon
which she discovered what &#8220;hanging&#8221; meant,
Colin and Andrew having suspended Tammy from
the apple tree. At times, Jean could raise her
voice otherwise than in song, and on that occasion
the whole Terrace resounded with her shrieks.</p>

<p>Next door there dwelt a very grumpy gentleman.
With that easy confidence in a neighbor&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
neighborliness generally manifested by people
who have lived much abroad, Jean&#8217;s father, on
taking up his quarters, had written asking permission
to put some wire-netting on the top of the
party wall to prevent cricket balls going over. To
his immense surprise he received a curt and discourteous
refusal, which terminated in a warning
to the effect that, if balls did come over, there
they would have to stay, as the writer would in no
circumstances have boys running in and out of his
house, and there was no back entrance. Of course
balls went over; but Colin and Andrew found an
unexpected ally in Mr. Knagg&#8217;s housekeeper, who
threw the balls back again without consulting him;
and Mr. Knagg felt rather aggrieved that, as yet,
he had found no cause for complaint. Complaint
in some form or other was as the breath of life
to him; he had gone to law with so many of his
fellow-townsmen that his society was no longer
sought after, and his exceedingly clean steps were
untrodden by strangers. He intended at first to
complain that the banjo-playing in the garden disturbed
him at his studies, when he happened to
hear Jean sing &#8220;This iss no my plaid,&#8221; and somehow
he gave up the idea.</p>

<p>Colin and Andrew possessed a &#8220;mashie&#8221; each,
and a game of &#8220;putting golf.&#8221; It was reserved
for Sunday afternoons as being of a quiet and
decorous nature.</p>

<p>But one Sunday afternoon Andrew forgot to
&#8220;putt,&#8221; and gave his ball a drive that lifted it
high over the wall into the next garden. Now, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
wall was too high to climb; besides, the fear of
Mr. Knagg was upon them, and the housekeeper
was out&mdash;they had seen her go. They had only
two balls, and it was yet a long two hours off teatime.
Father and mother were both out. They
retired to consult Jean under the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he wasn&#8217;t such an old beast, I&#8217;d go and ask
for it myself,&#8221; growled Andrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t get it if you did,&#8221; said Colin the
practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t Jean go? He&#8217;d give it to her,&#8221;
suggested Andrew, who had noted the weakness
of his sex where Jean was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he would. You must go, Jean.
Hurry up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, all on my lonely?&#8221; exclaimed Jean in
pained astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll come with you to the door and ring
the bell for you, and then cut away before he can
open it. Then you ask him nicely. Come on,
Jean!&#8221;</p>

<p>She seldom long opposed her brothers. She had
what Elspeth called a &#8220;tender head,&#8221; and strongly
objected to having her hair pulled. Between them
they marched her up the flagged path to Mr.
Knagg&#8217;s front door, rang loudly, and departed
precipitately.</p>

<p>Maighda, the great deerhound who shared with
Elspeth the guardianship of Jean, rose from
amidst the company of dolls, where she had been
reposing, and walking gravely into the front garden,
jumped the iron fence, and joined Jean at the
top of the steps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>Jean clasped Tammy firmly with one arm and
coiled the other round Maighda&#8217;s neck as the door
opened rather noisily to disclose an irate-looking
little gentleman in gold-rimmed <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; began Jean, in a still, small
voice, &#8220;there iss a wee ball-y wass putted into
your garden&mdash;will I get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Knagg stood staring at his strange visitors,
while Jean rubbed one pink foot over the other
and Maighda sniffed at him dubiously. Tammy,
with his customary reserve, betrayed no emotion
whatever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; said Mr. Knagg shortly, holding out
his hand. As Jean disappeared Colin and Andrew
flew into the back garden and swarmed up an
apple tree, whence they surveyed their sister&#8217;s
proceedings with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder why men are so much decenter to girls
than to us?&#8221; mused Andrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well; his housekeeper likes us best, anyway.
Everyone&#8217;s got their cranks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fore,&#8221; cried a clear little voice, and the ball
fell with a soft &#8220;plop&#8221; at the foot of the apple
tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;She throws very well for a girl,&#8221; said Colin
as he dropped onto the grass. &#8220;Let&#8217;s finish the
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;fore&#8217;?&#8221; asked Mr.
Knagg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heads, you know,&#8221; said Jean; but her host
was more puzzled than ever, for he had not even
a bowing acquaintance with the royal and ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
game. They stared at each other in silence for a
minute, then Jean, remembering that one of the
most important precepts of her clan was to accept
no service without rendering some return, said
shyly: &#8220;Will I sing you a song?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray do!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Knagg; and his eyeglasses
flew off his nose, he frowned so hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love&#8217;s in Germanie&mdash;send him hame! send
him hame! My love&#8217;s in Germanie&mdash;send him
hame!&#8221; Jean only sang three verses. Elspeth
never taught her the last two, and when the last
notes full of longing had died away, she added
cheerfully: &#8220;But he iss at home just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father. Nearly all my songs iss about
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Knagg, and blew his
nose noisily. &#8220;So that&#8217;s Scotch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All my songs iss Scottish. I promised Elspeth,
and I will know them all some day. Goot-bye!&#8221;
and Jean, settling Tammy more comfortably on
her arm, prepared to depart. As she spoke she
had lifted her face to be kissed, and Mr. Knagg
kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He iss a dull man,&#8221; said Jean confidentially
to Colin; &#8220;but he was douce enough to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in question sat in his favorite chair
and read his Sunday newspaper upside down. It
was thirty-five years since he had kissed a child!</p>

<p>Colin and Andrew were at school, father and
mother had gone out in the dog-cart, taking
Maighda with them for the run, Elspeth was ironing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
frocks, and Jean entertaining Tammy and all
the dolls at tea on the lawn. Suddenly she threw
back her head and listened&mdash;no one had such quick
ears as Jean&mdash;the color rushed to her face, and
she scampered across the grass, round by the side
of the house, and out at the garden gate; bareheaded,
with flying rosy feet, she raced to the end
of the terrace, and as she ran the sound which so
excited her grew louder. It was the pipes!</p>

<p>Would she find &#8220;the regiment,&#8221; she wondered?
Had it come to show what Elspeth called &#8220;this
wee stuck-up bit towney&#8221; what real John Hielandman
were like? Jean pictured the frowning castle
and windy Esplanade, the steep, stony street,
flanked by tall grey houses, down which &#8220;the regiment&#8221;
&#8220;in tartan plaid and philabeg&#8221; swept with
swinging steps. That was the setting in which
she knew her father&#8217;s men. How would they look
in this trim Southern town? And would she dare
to stop them to ask after her friends?</p>

<p>No, it was not a march the piper was playing,
and very soon she discovered that there was no
regiment&mdash;only a solitary piper playing the &#8220;Keel
Row,&#8221; with a crowd of unkempt children following
him.</p>

<p>Jean pushed in among the children, who made
way for this hatless, shoeless person in some astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He iss not the &#8216;Forty-second,&#8217; nor the &#8216;Gordons,&#8217;
nor the &#8216;Seaforth,&#8217;&#8221; said Jean to herself,
&#8220;and why will he wear two tartans?&#8221; Then, pulling
at the piper&#8217;s kilt, she cried shrilly, above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
skirl of the pipes: &#8220;Can you play &#8216;Oran an
Aoig&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>The piper took the chanter out of his mouth,
and smiled down at the eager, upturned face, asking:
&#8220;<i>Wot</i>, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oran an Aoig,&#8217;&#8221; repeated Jean eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I cawn&#8217;t oblige you, but I never &#8217;eard
tell of that toon,&#8221; and the &#8220;Keel Row&#8221; sounded
with renewed and aggressive vigor.</p>

<p>Jean loosed her hold of the kilt and turned to
go. There was something uncanny in the speech
of this piper, and as she looked more closely, a
certain incongruity in his uniform which chilled
and disappointed her. The children, however,
having recovered from their surprise at her sudden
appearance in their midst, decided to have
some fun with Jean, and she speedily discovered
that to be the only shoeless person in a heavily
shod crowd is to be in a most unpleasant minority.
Also, she had never been alone in the street before.</p>

<p>Mr. Knagg heard the pipes on his way home to
lunch, and having the greatest abhorrence of all
street noises, holding that they were, every one,
&#8220;disturbing to the peace of His Majesty&#8217;s lieges,&#8221;
was hurrying across the road to expostulate with
the perpetrator of this new outrage upon his ears,
when he caught sight of a familiar shining in the
very middle of that rabble of children. He laid
about him with his white cotton umbrella, presently
emerged from the crowd, bearing a very
tearful Jean in his arms, and hailed a cab. The
cab and the dog-cart drove up to Jean&#8217;s door at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the same moment. Mr. Knagg left Jean on the
pavement and stalked into his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said he was a douce man,&#8221; sobbed Jean, in
the safe shelter of her father&#8217;s arms; &#8220;but it wass
a pittence piper, not one of ours at all.&#8221; They
say that she felt the deception even more than
the bruises on her toes. Her father never managed
to thank Mr. Knagg though he called three
times.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Of course the master&#8217;s gone to the war with
the regiment. He only got six months&#8217; leave, after
all, and Miss Jean talks and sings about him all
day long, and the mistress just listens. But she
says if Master Colin and Master Andrew were
older, she&#8217;d send them, too; for there&#8217;s aye been
some of our family for the men to follow.&#8221; Elspeth
left Mr. Knagg&#8217;s housekeeper standing at the wire
fence, for she &#8220;never encouraged clash.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the wintry days her neighbors saw less of
Jean, as play in the garden was impossible. But
even then the pink feet splashed bravely through
the puddles and over the wet stones.</p>

<p>One evening about six, just as Mr. Knagg was
turning into the Terrace, a newspaper boy, shouting
with raucous voice, proclaimed: &#8220;Serious
British Reverse!&#8221; &#8220;&#8217;Ighland regiment trapped
and cut to pieces!&#8221; The old gentleman darted
across the road, crying: &#8220;Stop that infernal din,
and I&#8217;ll buy every rag you&#8217;ve got! Don&#8217;t come
down here again, mind!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried down the Terrace with a great
bundle of pink papers under his arm. Just outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
his own house he paused and looked up.
Jean&#8217;s nursery window was open at the top, the
curtains were not drawn, and the room was full
of rosy light. Suddenly a child&#8217;s voice soared
into the stillness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He&#8217;s as brave as brave can be;</div>
<div class="indent">Send him hame, send him hame!</div>
<div class="verse">He&#8217;s as brave as brave can be;</div>
<div class="indent4">Send him hame!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Knagg took off his hat and bent his head.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE DOLL&#8217;S-HOUSE FLAGS (1917)</h3>
</div>


<p>To begin with the youngest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; the war&#8217;s the same age,&#8221; said Jasper,
for Jasper was born on August 4th, 1914.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was why he manifested such a
decided and independent disposition almost from
his earliest months.</p>

<p>It may have been that everybody was so busy
he was more thrown upon his own resources than
are babies in more leisurely times. But whatever
the reason, he ran about when he was one, talked
fluently&mdash;if in somewhat impressionistic fashion&mdash;when
he was eighteen months old, and by the
time he was two he had attained very definite characteristics.</p>

<p>Barbara came next, four long years older than
Jasper. She had a round, rosy face and kind
brown eyes that readily filled with tears, and her
little heart overflowed with love and pity for the
wounded.</p>

<p>Alison was quite old when war broke out. She
could remember times when sweets &#8220;were nothing
so very much&mdash;everybody eat them,&#8221; when &#8220;gentlemen
often had <i>two</i> eggs for breakfast and lots
of other things as well,&#8221; when &#8220;Mummy could
buy anything she liked in shops, and nearly everybody
had motors.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>Alison was six when Jasper was born.</p>

<p>Tall and pale was Alison, with straight black
hair that reached her waist. She took the war
very seriously indeed, and was implacable in her
conviction that nothing else mattered. She was
even rather shocked that mummy could take comfort
in the thought that it would probably be over
before Jasper was old enough to join up.</p>

<p>Then there was George.</p>

<p>He was an American and the same age as Alison
and lived quite near, though after the unfriendly
fashion of London, they might never have known
him but that it happened his mummy and theirs
worked at the same hospital.</p>

<p>He was an &#8220;only,&#8221; and when they first knew
him went as a day boy to a preparatory school
quite a long way off; but as time went on and
transport of every kind became more crowded and
difficult, he came to do lessons with Alison and
Barbara.</p>

<p>Nothing made Barbara so happy as to be allowed
to visit the &#8220;dear poor ones&#8221; in the hospital
where mummy worked; but when she first
saw the blind soldiers from St. Dunstan&#8217;s and
they were explained to her, it seemed as though
she really could not bear the knowledge. The children
lived on the south side of Regent&#8217;s Park, and
Nannie always took them there for their walks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they never be able to see?&#8221; she would ask
piteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not in this life,&#8221; was Nannie&#8217;s invariable
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not anything? Ever?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>&#8220;Nothing at all. But they are very brave, Miss
Barbara; <i>they</i> don&#8217;t cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>For days after when Barbara met them in Regent&#8217;s
Park, her mouth would go down at the
corners, and though she did not actually cry she
was, as nurse said, &#8220;queer and quiet&#8221; for a long
time afterward. Their inexorable doom weighed
on her little soul, and even her serene faith in a
kind God and protecting angels and the &#8220;tender
Shepherd&#8221; of her prayers was somewhat shaken
that such a cruel thing could be. Ah! if they could
only have met <i>Him</i>! He would have &#8220;touched
their eyes&#8221; and all would have been well. Perhaps
some day&mdash;&mdash; In the meantime the fairies&mdash;and
she believed in them as firmly as in the heavenly
hierarchy itself&mdash;came to her aid, and by
some process of reasoning she decided that the
blinded soldiers were under an enchantment.
That a wicked ogre, a German ogre, had taken
away their sight (even as trolls and cruel step-mothers
and evilly disposed fairies blinded her
favorite heroes in the &#8220;Tales from the Norse&#8221;),
but that some day a kind fairy or wise, friendly
beast would put them in the way of getting their
eyes back again. Surely among all the animals in
the Zoo there would be one who knew exactly under
what tree in the Park the healing dew might
be found.</p>

<p>She never spoke of the St. Dunstan&#8217;s men as
blind, but as the &#8220;poor enchanted ones,&#8221; to distinguish
them from the &#8220;dear poor ones&#8221; of the
hospital, and she would never speak of &#8220;Blindman&#8217;s
Buff,&#8221; but always of &#8220;Enchanted Buff.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Jasper had learned to salute and was immensely
proud of himself. Every man in khaki or hospital
blue that came in his way, from brass-hats to the
most newly joined recruits, received his respectful
and ecstatic salutation. Two-foot-six in a
white Persian lamb coat and white gaiters would
stand rigidly to attention and bring up a diminutive
hand clad in a white glove smartly to his forehead.
If the man he desired to honor happened
to be in hospital blue, he then kissed his hand to
express affection as well as respect. When the
warrior in question perceived Jasper he invariably
returned the courtesy with <i>empressement</i>. Generals
were most punctilious in this matter, and
when Jasper saw one coming he would trot forward,
plant himself firmly in the line of vision of
the eyes under the brass hat, and, rosy and triumphant,
wait till Nannie came up, announcing
proudly: &#8220;I t&#8217;luted &#8217;im <i>and</i> he t&#8217;luted me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone smiled upon Jasper. He was so small
and round and earnest, and his absurd hair curled
around the edge of his cap in the most entrancing
fashion. He knew he was popular and enjoyed it
amazingly.</p>

<p>Therefore was he surprised and chilled when
one day, having as usual trotted ahead of Nannie,
he stopped opposite two blue soldiers resting on a
seat in the park and they took not the slightest
notice of him.</p>

<p>They seemed to be looking right at him as he
stood at salute, but they neither &#8220;t&#8217;luted,&#8221; nor
did they smile or speak.</p>

<p>Jasper kissed his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>Still no response.</p>

<p>He kissed his hand, and blew the kiss right at
them.</p>

<p>Puzzled, he looked from one to the other. They
weren&#8217;t asleep. Their eyes were wide open, and
their faces kind and patient, but they didn&#8217;t seem
a bit glad to see him.</p>

<p>They just took no notice&mdash;no notice at all. And
Nannie came up with the pram.</p>

<p>&#8220;I t&#8217;luted &#8217;em,&#8221; he said in rather trembling
tones, quite unlike his usual strong treble, &#8220;but
they don&#8217;t seem to like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, what?&#8221; said one of the men suddenly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie said something hurriedly in a low voice.
&#8220;He&#8217;s only two and a bit,&#8221; she added. Then, &#8220;It&#8217;s
too cold for you to be sitting there. Have you lost
your bearings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it,&#8221; said the man who had first
spoken. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll put us on our way. It&#8217;s
time we were getting back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go with you. Give him your hand, dear,
and bring him along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>did</i> t&#8217;lute &#8217;em,&#8221; Jasper said again, feeling
that an important ceremony had somehow been
scamped.</p>

<p>Both the men stood up, and the one who had
spoken to Nannie jogged his friend with his elbow,
saying: &#8220;And so do we salute you, young
man,&#8221; and they both did.</p>

<p>The man put down his hand and touched the
top of Jasper&#8217;s Persian lamb cap, and laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a big man!&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>And hand in hand they followed Nannie to St.
Dunstan&#8217;s.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Now you know what it&#8217;s like for the poor enchanted
ones,&#8221; Barbara said, taking her hands
from Jasper&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Jasper looked very solemn. &#8220;Poor &#8217;chanted
ones,&#8221; he echoed; &#8220;I&#8217;ll t&#8217;lute &#8217;em and kiss my
hand <i>and</i> kirtsey ne&#8217;st time I meet &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk to them, my dear,&#8221; said sensible
Nannie; &#8220;they&#8217;ll like that better than all your
salutin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Jasper was most ready to do at great length
in his little high voice that the poor enchanted
ones came to recognize a long way off. But all
the same he never failed to &#8220;t&#8217;lute and kiss his
hand <i>and</i> kirtsey.&#8221; No signs of respect and affection
could be too much, Barbara said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the worst thing of all, so we must love
them most.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fairies and angels were inextricably mixed up
in Barbara&#8217;s mind, and when her mother came to
kiss her good-night on Christmas Eve, she murmured
sleepily: &#8220;I simply can&#8217;t &#8217;astinguish between
God and Father Christmas, so I mus&#8217; just
let it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the toys were much affected by the war.
Jasper&#8217;s Teddy Bear wore an expression not unlike
the pathetic puzzled look of his brethren in
the Mappin Circle, now that nobody threw them
buns, sat they on their tails never so pleadingly.
Alison had made him the brassard of a special
constable, and he always wore it when he went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
with Jasper in the pram. The lady dolls had all
become V.A.D.&#8217;s or bus conductors or window-cleaners,
and one quite recent acquisition was a
land girl.</p>

<p>As for the doll&#8217;s house, it wore a martial yet
festive air, for the flags of all the allies were
stuck in a tight band of string with which Alison
had bound it thrice just under the roof.</p>

<p>It was not a new doll&#8217;s house. In fact as doll&#8217;s
houses go it was almost venerable. It had belonged
to grannie&#8217;s mother, and was built in the
early part of Queen Victoria&#8217;s reign. Unlike
modern doll&#8217;s houses, it did not open in front.
In front it was square and solid, with two large
windows on either side of the door, which had
glass panels, and actually opened and shut, and
there were three oblong windows on the next floor.
The roof was made of real little slates, with chimneys
at either end of it. The ground floor was a
shop, with two black counters that could be taken
out and dusted, and the walls were fitted with innumerable
shelves and cupboards. It was a silversmith&#8217;s
shop, and on the brass plates under the
windows were, on one, &#8220;David Strachan, Silversmith
and Jeweler,&#8221; on the other, &#8220;By Appointment
to Her Majesty Queen Victoria.&#8221; By which
it could be seen that it was a Scottish jeweler&#8217;s
shop, for nobody called &#8220;Strachan&#8221; could be of
any other nationality. Moreover, there were tiny
toddy-ladles of various sizes among the stock-in-trade.</p>

<p>Daddy used to tell the children an entrancing
serial story about the inhabitants of this wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
house, whereof most of the plenishings remained
in their original form, though Mr. and
Mrs. Strachan, the two shop assistants, and the
baby, had been renewed from time to time, but
always as nearly as possible resembling their predecessors.
Thus it came about that Mr. Strachan
had side-whiskers&mdash;daddy painted them himself&mdash;a
stock and peg-top trousers, and Mrs. Strachan
a crinoline and an amazingly slender waist; while
Jenny, the maid, who slept in a box-bed in the
kitchen, had a mob-cap and always wore her
sleeves rolled up. The bedroom of Mr. and Mrs.
Strachan was much bemuslined, and the parlor
had green rep chairs and a round table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all of our doll&#8217;s house,&#8221; Barbara used to
say. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t belong to anyone partickler.
Grannie said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George&#8217;s, too,&#8221; Jasper always added. He
couldn&#8217;t bear George to be left out of anything.</p>

<p>And perhaps because George was an American
he was a little less on his dignity than an English
boy of the same age. He didn&#8217;t despise girls, he
treated them in a comradely fashion that Alison
and Barbara greatly appreciated. And Jasper
adored him, for George realized that a person
might be not quite three, with nether garments
so abbreviated as to be almost indistinguishable
from petticoats, with woolly gaiters and shoes so
small they refused to make a martial tramp, however
much one tried&mdash;and yet the said person
might possess the most boyish soul in the world.</p>

<p>Therefore was George made free of the doll&#8217;s
house, and assisted Alison with the serial story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
which she had taken over since that day, early in
the war, when daddy went with his Territorial
battalion to France.</p>

<p>It was on New Year&#8217;s Day in 1917 that George
brought Alison the American flag for the doll&#8217;s
house. It was a beautiful little silk one, and he
had selected it himself at Selfridge&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like Mr. Strachan should have it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We want the allies to win. You bet we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Alison shook her head. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I hate not to take it&mdash;I&#8217;ll have it myself
if you like, but it can&#8217;t go on the house. Not yet it
can&#8217;t. America&#8217;s not in, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said George, &#8220;we&#8217;ve done a good
bit, haven&#8217;t we? Look at my dad&mdash;he&#8217;s been driving
an ambulance&mdash;he gave it himself&mdash;ever since
the beginning of the war, and he&#8217;s been wounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Alison answered, &#8220;I know all that,
but&#8221;&mdash;and her grave little face was set like a
flint&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re not in it yet, you&#8217;re not <i>fighting</i>,
and only countries that are fighting <i>with</i> us can
have their flags on the doll&#8217;s house. Mr. Strachan&#8217;s
most partickler about that. My daddy&#8217;s been
wounded twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he have it at the back?&#8221; Barbara
suggested. She couldn&#8217;t bear people to be hurt,
and George looked very much hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; he said haughtily. &#8220;If it
can&#8217;t be put with the others, you needn&#8217;t have it
at all. It&#8217;s a great flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Alison, &#8220;and I&#8217;m awfully
sorry. Mr. Strachan would love it the minute
you&#8217;re really in ... but till you are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;re in right enough,&#8221; George said bitterly,
&#8220;in up to the neck. Mother says so. It&#8217;s only the
President hasn&#8217;t said &#8216;Go&#8217; yet&mdash;you know what
Governments are, &#8216;waiting and seeing,&#8217; and all
that rot. Look at your own! And everybody getting
killed all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Alison said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s what makes
the difference. We <i>are</i> getting killed, all the time,
even here in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>George put the little flag in his pocket. &#8220;I came
to wish you a happy New Year, Alison,&#8221; he said
with an effort to speak pleasantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
get you something else. There&#8217;s some little silver
things for the shop for you, Barbara, and a machine-gun
for Jasper. Perhaps the partickler Mr.
Strachan wouldn&#8217;t mind having that on his roof
to fire at the Huns when they come over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me keep the flag?&#8221; Alison asked.
&#8220;Then if ever America....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever,&#8221; George interrupted scornfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all you know about it. If you&#8217;ll wait
you&#8217;ll jolly well see this time. And you won&#8217;t
wait long!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he kept the flag in his pocket; and that
night he put it in an envelope to keep it clean.</p>

<p>George was right. She didn&#8217;t have to wait so
very much longer, for on April 6th, America declared
war on Germany, and he appeared directly
after breakfast waving a Stars and Stripes large
enough to have covered the doll&#8217;s house like a
tablecloth, so they hung it out of the nursery window
instead, and Jasper &#8220;t&#8217;luted&#8221; it when he
went out in his pram. And Alison got the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
flag from George and put it between that of England
and France on the doll&#8217;s house, and he
further presented the Strachans with two little
khaki gunners to man the gun on the roof, for
there were rumors to the effect that London would
get it particularly hot that summer. The Huns
were so angry about America.</p>

<p>That very morning great-uncle Jasper came to
see the children, and gave each of them, including
George, a bright new half-crown.</p>

<p>Jasper was much pleased with his, and refused
to be parted from it even after Nannie had dressed
him to go out. He declared he would hold it exceedingly
tight and not &#8220;jop&#8221; it. Nannie had
taken him with her down to the kitchen to get the
list of wanted groceries from cook, and before you
could say &#8220;knife&#8221; he had raced into the scullery,
mounted a chair, and thrust the new half-crown
down into one of the divisions of the knife-machine,
proclaiming triumphantly that it was &#8220;a
bid money-box.&#8221; And there the half-crown remains
to this day unless somebody has been
demobilized who understands Kent&#8217;s knife-machines.</p>

<p>Nannie hated to take Jasper to shops instead
of the Park, but she had to do it sometimes because
things had to be got and there was no one else to
fetch them; besides, the &#8220;pram was handy for
parcels.&#8221; He thoroughly enjoyed these expeditions
and certainly cheered up the shopping of
other people.</p>

<p>That morning when they arrived at the grocer&#8217;s
there was the usual tired, cross-looking throng of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
housewives bearing string bags, irascible old gentlemen
with leather ones, and the inevitable slate
with the restrictive announcement: &#8220;No Matches.
No Jam. No Bacon. No Tea. No Cheese. No
Lard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; muttered Nannie. &#8220;No cheese
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No tzeeze adain,&#8221; Jasper instantly repeated,
but in ringing tones that might have indicated
glorious news, and everybody laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless his heart,&#8221; said Nannie when she got
home, &#8220;he does his bit as well as anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alison was always ready enough to take care of
Jasper, and was thoroughly trustworthy as regards
letting no harm befall him; but she looked
upon such &#8220;minding&#8221; in the light of &#8220;war work,&#8221;
and her methods were somewhat austere.</p>

<p>She was annoyed that he should constantly interrupt
mummy when she read aloud the latest
war news from <i>The Times</i> by frivolous calls for
admiration of his clock-work rabbit, and that
mummy never failed to respond. And Alison was
positively shocked that he could go on playing
absorbedly with the said rabbit even when mummy
read to them a letter from daddy in France.</p>

<p>She forgot that, for Jasper, daddy was chiefly
known as a picture in a frame that stood on a
table by mummy&#8217;s bed, whereof he kissed the
glass, making a smudge on it, every night when
he had said his prayers; whereas the familiar rabbit
was furry and comforting to carry, and went
across the floor in a succession of exciting hops
when it was wound up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>After all, Jasper was but a very little boy.</p>

<p>As for Barbara, she followed where Jasper led.
Barbara was no sort of use for minding. Yet she
could devise most delightful games, and gave
dolls&#8217; tea-parties when all the vanished delicacies
that used to grace such festivities before the war
appeared again. So lavish was she with chocolate
&eacute;claires and cream buns and &#8220;white and pink
sugar cakes&#8221; that Alison, the conscientious, was
moved to expostulate, exclaiming: &#8220;What about
the rationing, Barbara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no war in fairyland,&#8221; Barbara answered
serenely, &#8220;and this is a fairy tea, so you
can have as many lumps of sugar as ever you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jasper was a cause of anxiety at these functions,
because he <i>would</i> put a whole plate in his
mouth at once. The V.A.D. doll fell over backward,
she was so shocked. Such voluptuous gastronomic
joys as chocolate &eacute;claires and cream buns
woke no responsive thrill in Jasper&#8217;s breast, for
he had never either seen nor tasted one or the
other, so when called upon to pretend to eat something,
he seized the nearest thing of handy size.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The children&#8217;s house had a basement, but
George&#8217;s mother lived in a beautiful Willet house
that had none, so that autumn he and his mother
and their maids used to run over &#8220;to spend the
raid&#8221; with Jasper&#8217;s household when the first
maroons sounded.</p>

<p>After the Zeppelin raids the doll&#8217;s house had
been brought down from the nursery to a room in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
the basement where there was a gas fire, and the
children used to play with it and enact many thrilling
dramas while the raids were going on. As
George had prophesied, London got it particularly
hot during the harvest moon of 1917, with five
raids in eight nights.</p>

<p>They had all just got back from a holiday in
the country and, with the exception of Barbara,
who was gun-shy and hated the noise, they really
felt the strain far less than the grown-ups.</p>

<p>Jasper usually slept most of the time in his
mother&#8217;s arms, but after a particularly loud crash
would rouse himself to murmur with sleepy complacency:
&#8220;That was a good one. We got &#8217;em
that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Barbara, when the barrage was unusually
deafening and prolonged, remarked rather piteously:
&#8220;How it must &#8217;asturb the poor angels!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was during the very last raid of all, in May
of the following year, that something happened
to the doll&#8217;s house. It was on a Sunday night,
and the maroons didn&#8217;t start till eleven o&#8217;clock.
George and his household hurried over as soon as
he had got some clothes on, and Jasper woke up
and was very talkative and cheerful. Arrayed in
a blue dressing-gown and bed-shoes, he ran about
the room, interfering with George and his sisters
in their arrangement of the Strachan family, and
shouting lustily in concert with the louder
crashes.</p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t often allowed to touch the interior of
the doll&#8217;s house, for his methods were too Bolshevist,
and he was inclined to instigate conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
wholly opposed to the characters of so <i>douce</i> and
respectable a family.</p>

<p>That night Barbara insisted that Jeannie, the
maid, and the baby should take refuge under one
of the counters, while Mr. and Mrs. Strachan and
the shop assistants crouched behind the other.</p>

<p>It happened that just then Jasper had developed
a mania for collecting smooth, round stones, and
Alison had suggested he should form an ammunition
dump to supply the Strachans&#8217; machine-gun.
This dump he was allowed to build near the
stumpy little low oak table on casters that had
supported the doll&#8217;s house from the time it was
first built. Mummy had carefully explained to
him that he must on no account throw the stones <i>at</i>
anything, because Jasper came of three generations
of left-hand bowlers, and had already shown
that he could throw a ball in the direction he
wanted it to go. So far he had never thrown a
stone either at things or people, for he was a kind
little soul and no more disobedient than the generality
of small boys of three. But he carried a
stone in his hand all day long unless Nannie discovered
it and took it from him. He liked the
feel of it, its smoothness, its roundness, its vast
potentialities.</p>

<p>That night he had been shooed away from the
doll&#8217;s house half a dozen times, for Alison and
George were absorbed in a thrilling play in which
the Strachans captured a German spy who was
guiding enemy air-craft by means of forbidden
lights.</p>

<p>Just as the &#8220;Archies&#8221; were barking their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
loudest, and an unmistakable bomb dropped somewhere,
Jasper, on the other side of the room, gave
a whoop and let fly the stone he had in his left
hand straight at the doll&#8217;s-house roof. It took one
of the wooden chimneys broadside on and broke
it clean off, narrowly missing the massed heads
of his two sisters and George, which were luckily
almost inside the house absorbed in the spy drama.</p>

<p>It also cracked some of the neat little slates on
the roof.</p>

<p>There was a general consternation and excitement,
and Jasper scurried across the room to secure
another stone from the dump, when he would
have undoubtedly had a shot at the other chimney
had not Nannie caught him and held him tight.</p>

<p>Then it was that Alison astonished her family,
for instead of demanding instant and condign punishment
for her destructive little brother, she
danced about the room and burst into poetry,
shouting at the top of her voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Strachans are in the War Zone, their house has been hit,</div>
<div class="verse">They&#8217;ve caught a bad spy and they&#8217;re all done their bit.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a most onaccountable child, Miss Alison,&#8221;
said Nannie to cook next day; &#8220;she was
actually sorry that the stone didn&#8217;t go right
through the roof, an&#8217; you&#8217;d have thought she&#8217;d
have gone on ever so ... anyway, it kept them
from caring much about the raid.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CONCERNING CHRIS AND EASTER (1916)</h3>
</div>


<p>Easter is the only girl, a sort of happy afterthought
at the end of a long family of five boys,
with six years between her and her next brother.</p>

<p>Chris is the only precious child, born after a
good many years of marriage to devoted and
adoring parents.</p>

<p>Easter doesn&#8217;t think much of boys. They are
common as blackberries in her family and she is
keenly sensible of her own distinction in having,
as she puts it, &#8220;chosen to come as a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it came about that her mental attitude
struck Chris with something of a shock; not
wholly unpleasant; stimulating; the tingle of resentment
tempered by a thrill of amused surprise.
It was so odd and new to meet anyone who felt
like that.</p>

<p>Besides, till he came to live in Easter&#8217;s village
he had been rather lonely, and she supplied a felt
want. Especially had this been so in the last two
bewildering years, for his parents had seemed less
absorbed in him than was quite dutiful. And for
the last year his father had vanished altogether
to that mysterious place that swallowed up so
many pleasant and familiar folk; that overshadowing,
omnipotent, vastly extending region
known as &#8220;the front.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Easter, on her part, welcomed the society of
Chris. She, too, was lonely by reason of the very
same cause as Chris. Little girls were scarce in
that village and Easter&#8217;s mother was busy all day
long with war work of one sort and another, and
owing to the same cause Chris&#8217;s governess, Miss
Radley, only gave him her society during the bare
hours of lessons, which lessons had for some time
been shared by Easter.</p>

<p>Now Easter was much better at lessons than
Chris; much quicker, in most things far more intelligent
and receptive. Only in arithmetic did
Chris shine, and in this subject he had soared
away from Easter and did abstruse calculations
in the end of the book all by himself with Miss
Radley.</p>

<p>Easter was born on an Easter Day, and this
year she was eight years old. Chris was born on
Christmas Day, and last Christmas he was eight.
Therefore, in spite of his prowess in arithmetic,
he maintains that he is a year older than Easter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you born in 1908?&#8221; he demands
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; answers Easter, &#8220;on an Easter Sunday.
They <i>were</i> so pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; says Chris, &#8220;was born in 1907. Take
seven from eight and what remains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One, but it isn&#8217;t a real, whole one,&#8221; Easter
objects.</p>

<p>No one knows this better than Chris, but he
stoutly maintains: &#8220;A year&#8217;s a year, and you&#8217;re
either born in it or you&#8217;re not&mdash;so there.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, in spite of this and many other differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
of opinion, they had decided to get married
when they came to what Easter&#8217;s nurse calls
&#8220;a suitable age.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a rule Chris follows blindly where Easter
leads, giving in to her stronger will and considerably
stronger body, though not always without
protest.</p>

<p>Easter is tall for her age and very muscular.
She has a gentle, early-Victorian, regularly featured,
delicately tinted face, with a high forehead,
abundant curly, fair hair, and large pathetic
blue eyes that are entirely misleading. In fact,
her appearance is as unlike her real character as
it is possible for such an extremely agreeable exterior
to be. She looks all softness and gravity
and gentle melancholy. Whereas she is a ruthless
and determined young person who cares nothing
for &#8220;moral suasion&#8221; and less for punishments
and penalties, provided she gets her own
way.</p>

<p>Chris, on the contrary, is soft-hearted and easily
ruled through his affections. He would rather not
be disobedient and troublesome unless such breakings
of the law are expressly commanded by
Easter.</p>

<p>But to be called a &#8220;muff&#8221; is more than he can
bear, and rather than Easter should think this of
him he will offend his whole dynasty of friends.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chris and Easter were sitting under a hedge
brilliant with scarlet hips and cloudy with &#8220;traveler&#8217;s
joy.&#8221; The hedge topped a fairly steep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
bank, with a ditch full of muddy water at the
bottom of the bank.</p>

<p>A heated argument was in progress as to the
names of their eight daughters. Easter had already
chosen the names, and they ran as follows:
Irene, Semolina, Rosalind, Majorca, Minorca,
Vinolia, Larola, and Salonica. Chris objected to
Semolina and Vinolia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate semolina,&#8221; he observed gloomily, &#8220;almost
as bad as I hate rice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it sounds so much nicer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Vinolia, too&mdash;greasy stuff you smear on
chapped legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got a lovely smell,&#8221; said Easter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why,&#8221; demanded Chris, who was in a
bold and captious mood, &#8220;should there be eight of
&#8217;em? Why can&#8217;t there be some boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have boys, I tell you,&#8221; Easter declared
firmly. &#8220;Girls are far prettier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Are</i> they?&#8221; asked Chris incredulously. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never seen any pretty ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of asking &#8220;Where are your eyes?&#8221;
Easter said huffily, in life-like imitation of nurse:
&#8220;That&#8217;s as it may be. Anyway they wear far
prettier clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t,&#8221; Chris pointed out.</p>

<p>Easter looked down at her extremely short and
faded navy-blue skirt, at her long legs stuck out
in front of her, at her muddy boots, at the large
hole in the knee of her stocking. Save for the
said skirt she was dressed almost exactly like
Chris, in muffin cap, reefer and brass buttons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I do,&#8221; she maintained; &#8220;but anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Irene, Semolina, and Rosalind, and Majorca,
and Minorca, and Vinolia, and Larola, and Salonica
will all have lovely frocks, silk ninon, with
sashes. Chris, they&#8217;ll be perfectly sweet, and we&#8217;ll
make them walk two and two in front of us to
church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; Chris declared, unmoved by this
entrancing vision, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t <i>want</i> so many
daughters. I don&#8217;t like them, I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em
and I won&#8217;t have &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Easter ejaculated in breathless tones
that should have warned him, &#8220;I shan&#8217;t marry
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; the callous Chris announced.
&#8220;The country wants men. I heard my daddy say
so the last time he was home. There&#8217;s far too
many women as it is. They can&#8217;t fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t they?&#8221; the indignant Easter exclaimed
ironically, and giving Chris a vigorous and wholly
unexpected push, rolled him down the steep bank
and into the ditch with a mighty splash; and then,
adding insult to injury, she dug her heels into the
wet grass, and taking off with skill and surety,
jumped over his prostrate body on to the road,
whereupon she ran away, laughing derisively.</p>

<p>Chris got most uncommonly wet, for the bottom
of the ditch was slimy and soft. Even after he
had struggled to his feet they slipped about and
sank in far over the tops of his boots. And when
he did manage to scramble up the bank to the road,
he certainly looked a deplorable object, covered
with mud and green slime and with water oozing
from every bit of him. He stamped his feet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
rubbed them on the wet grass that bordered the
road without much visible betterment.</p>

<p>There was no going back through the village in
such a plight, so he climbed the first five-barred
gate he saw and started on a long cross-country
journey that was to bring him home by unfrequented
ways. He found the unfrequented ways,
for he didn&#8217;t meet a soul, but he lost his bearings
altogether. The wind got up and there followed
cold, gusty showers of rain and hail. He felt
chilled and miserable and dreadfully tired. Field
after field he traversed and yet found no familiar
landmarks, till, having toiled uphill over a heavy
ploughed field, he reached a road that stood fairly
high, and below him on the far horizon he recognized
the square tower of his own church. He
plodded on and on till at last he trotted wearily
up his own drive, and there he saw that not only
Miss Radley but the three maids were all gathered
on the steps of the front door. The moment Miss
Radley saw him she ran toward him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Chris! Where <i>have</i> you been? We were
getting so anxious. Do you know it&#8217;s half-past
five? My dear boy, how wet you are! Come in
and get changed at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maids went back into the house when they
saw Chris, and Miss Radley hurried him in and
upstairs, not even waiting to make him wipe his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been so anxious,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I
went to Easter&#8217;s, and she said you&#8217;d parted ever
so long ago. Why did you go off by yourself like
that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Chris was half in, half out of his sailor blouse
by this time, and mumbled something about having
got tired of Easter.</p>

<p>Miss Radley didn&#8217;t worry him much with questions,
nor did she comment severely upon his dirty
state. She was extraordinarily kind and got her
hands all over mud in helping him to take off his
boots; and it was not until he was lying luxuriously
in a hot bath that it struck him as odd that his
mother didn&#8217;t come to him. All the time, too, he
had the feeling that Miss Radley wanted to tell
him something and yet she couldn&#8217;t seem to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s mummy?&#8221; he asked at last. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
she back yet? I wish she&#8217;d come and talk to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Radley looked queerly at him, almost as
though she were going to cry. &#8220;Chris dear,&#8221; she
said, and waited for quite a long time, &#8220;mummy
has had to go away....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Away! For the night? Where to? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris dear&#8221;&mdash;again Miss Radley seemed to
find it difficult to go on&mdash;&#8220;she had a telegram, just
after you went out, from the War Office, asking
her to go at once. Your father is in a hospital at
Boulogne, very ill ... wounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dangerously wounded?&#8221; asked Chris, who was
familiar with war terms.</p>

<p>Miss Radley nodded, and two tears ran down
her cheeks. &#8220;That&#8217;s what it said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Chris, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get out of
this bath now.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he was dressed he didn&#8217;t seem to want
the long-delayed tea, even though there was a
beautiful brown egg and lovely buttered toast. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
spite of the hot bath and a bright fire in the schoolroom
he felt horrid, cold trickles running down
his back all the time. He was extremely tired, too,
yet only conscious of one overwhelming want&mdash;to
be taken on his mother&#8217;s knee and comforted.
Miss Radley took him on hers and sat with him
right in front of the fire. She was very kind and
told him how sorry mummy had been to go off in
such a hurry without saying good-bye, but there
was just one train that would reach London that
night if she caught it at the junction; and the
squire, Easter&#8217;s father, had driven her himself
in his motor, and they just managed; and she was
crossing to France that night in charge of a
brother officer of dad&#8217;s&mdash;she had her passport
long ago.</p>

<p>Every now and then Miss Radley lightly touched
his face, which was very hot, and then she would
hold his hand, which was very cold. Half-asleep,
Chris would murmur from time to time, &#8220;dangerously
wounded,&#8221; but somehow he couldn&#8217;t feel
about it as he knew he ought to feel. Though he
adored his daddy, all he felt was this overpowering
ache of longing for his mother.</p>

<p>Easter&#8217;s scornful refusal to have any boys in
her family had hurt him very much. He felt lonely
and pushed out, somehow; and he badly wanted
the one person who never failed in her appreciation
of little boys, even if they were thin and
small and not particularly good looking, and could
not run so fast as ... certain little girls. He
was conscious of being all these undesirable things,
and yet he was convinced it was a great and glorious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
thing to be a boy, even if Easter didn&#8217;t think
so. Once, after a long and acrimonious discussion
with her on this very subject, he had said to
his mother: &#8220;I choosed to come as a boy, didn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God chose,&#8221; said his mother gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me and God settled it together,&#8221; Chris announced
complacently, and his mother got up suddenly
and looked in a cupboard for something she
never found.</p>

<p>In Chris&#8217;s mind God and Father Christmas
were inextricably mixed up. He had no fear of
either one or the other. Both were beneficent and
considerate and ready to give people their choice
both as to presents or other things.</p>

<p>Yet when he was put to bed that night he
couldn&#8217;t dream of pleasant, soothing things, but
was pursued by eight strong daughters in embroidered
ninon frocks and pink sashes, who
formed themselves into a solid phalanx and drove
him to the edge of an awful precipice, and were
just pushing him over ... when he would wake
to find Miss Radley standing beside his bed, looking
anxious and troubled, shading a candle with
her hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The war had not touched Easter very nearly.
Her mother had forbidden nurse to talk about it
to her; and her father (judging her sensitiveness
wholly from her gentle, Early-Victorian appearance)
was careful to keep all frightening or depressing
news from her as far as was possible.
All her life she had been sheltered and adored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
and spared and spoiled. Her brothers, being so
much older, had &#8220;given in&#8221; to her from the very
first, and although the two eldest were fighting&mdash;one
in the navy, the other in the army&mdash;their doings
did not seem to affect her particularly. And
of the three still at school she had, of late, seen
very little, for in the holidays they were always
doing O.T.C. training, or making munitions somewhere.</p>

<p>Yet one thing had impressed her during the last
two years. She was always hearing that some of
their acquaintances had &#8220;lost&#8221; a son, a brother,
or a husband. They did not talk of &#8220;killed&#8221; or
&#8220;missing&#8221; to Easter; but they did speak of this
continual and mysterious &#8220;loss,&#8221; and with the
queer secretive puzzledom of childhood she never
asked people outright what they meant by the
phrase.</p>

<p>It worried her, this continual losing. She
never heard that these lost ones got found again.
Suppose she herself got lost in this irretrievable
way? How dreadful it would be. What would
her family do? In justice to Easter one must
allow that the thought of her people&#8217;s consternation
quite overshadowed any possibly unpleasant
consequences to herself.</p>

<p>She had never discussed the question with Chris,
who knew a lot about the war and wanted to talk
about it to the exclusion of more interesting topics&mdash;such
as daughters. But this was easily overruled.
Moreover, Easter&#8217;s mother had decided
that far too much was said about the war in Chris&#8217;s
hearing, and she had asked Miss Radley to warn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
him not to talk about it to Easter lest it should
upset her.</p>

<p>Miss Radley had her own opinion of Easter&#8217;s
sensibility. She had not taught the children for
six months without discovering which was the
more susceptible and imaginative. But she did as
she was bid, and Chris had done his best to obey
in his turn. Perhaps in a lofty masculine way he
was rather proud that he should be allowed to
know things closely hidden from the domineering
Easter, and was therefore the less anxious to
share his knowledge with her.</p>

<p>He whole-heartedly admired Easter. She was
so strong, so good at things, so invariably cheerful
and well, with a never-failing fund of good
spirits and energy. It is very possible that one
of her chief attractions for him lay in the fact that
she seemed so entirely outside those great and
grave anxieties that obsessed everybody else.</p>

<p>Easter was brought up to understand that any
&#8220;career&#8221; that she chose was open to her. She
should have an equal chance with any of her
brothers; she might be a doctor for a factory inspector,
or a police-woman, or go in for any art or
craft she fancied. Literature, art, music, even the
stage, were to be open to her, should she so wish.
But, so far, her sole ambition was centred in the
possession of a husband, a meek husband, and
eight meek daughters to move and have their
being at her decree.</p>

<p>It was the swing of the pendulum with a vengeance.</p>

<p>No one told Easter about Chris&#8217;s daddy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
afternoon. In the evening she prepared her lessons
with her customary energy and intelligence,
and giggled cheerfully from time to time at the
recollection of Chris&#8217;s comical appearance as he
lay floundering in the ditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll teach him,&#8221; said Easter to herself,
&#8220;whether it&#8217;s to be daughters or not!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next morning at breakfast her mother said:
&#8220;Miss Radley can&#8217;t take you to-day, Easter dear,
so it&#8217;s no use your going over. They had very bad
news yesterday, and Mrs. Denver has had to go to
France. The major is very ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Chris gone?&#8221; Easter asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear; but Miss Radley sent over a note
quite early to say he has got a bad, feverish cold
(he got so wet yesterday&mdash;it&#8217;s a pity he didn&#8217;t
come back with you), and we don&#8217;t know what it
may turn to. So you must just take a holiday, for
I&#8217;m due at the hospital supplies at ten, and shall
be away all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Major Denver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said her mother, anxiously watching
the earnest, delicately tinted face upturned to
hers, &#8220;I fear he is very badly wounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Easter, and she looked very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be as happy as you can, my precious,&#8221; her
mother called to her as she drove away. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
home as early as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a very long day for Easter.</p>

<p>For one thing, it rained all the morning; for
another, her father had to go a long way off on
business connected with special constables, and
couldn&#8217;t take her; and Amelia, the usually cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
housemaid, went about the house with red eyes
and a perpetual sniff, because she had heard that
morning she&#8217;d lost a cousin in the &#8220;big push on
the Somme.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amelia was distinctly depressing.</p>

<p>Easter knitted a few rows of her scarf&mdash;the
scarf that was always begun by her and finished
by somebody else because she got tired of it. She
found she was missing Chris far more poignantly
than was at all pleasant.</p>

<p>After all, even if he didn&#8217;t always quite give in
to her, he was good company; and Easter found
herself remembering many kind things he had
done. The chocolates he had always shared so
generously, the apples so unequally divided always
in her favor. Once when she fell off a wall and
scratched her hands and tore her frock so badly,
he hadn&#8217;t laughed, and he was so seldom rough
in play, only when unbearably provoked. Easter
was too honest not to admit that even at the time.</p>

<p>It cleared up in the afternoon and she ran over
to the Denvers&#8217; house to see if Chris was up yet
and could play.</p>

<p>Emma, the parlormaid, was firm in her refusal
to admit Easter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Chris is that bad, so feverish it might
turn to anything, the doctor says. Miss Radley
said no one was to come in, and she haven&#8217;t left
Master Chris a single minute herself. It&#8217;s dreadful,
and us all in such trouble about the major,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t lost him, have you?&#8221; Easter
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;Good gracious! no, not yet, so far as we
knows. But he&#8217;s as bad as bad, and,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;if anything was to happen to Master Chris and
his ma away an&#8217; all&mdash;but, there! I can&#8217;t bear to
think of it. You run along home, Miss Easter.
I&#8217;ll tell Miss Radley you came to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the door was shut in Easter&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Next day the news was no better. Even Easter&#8217;s
mother could not keep from her the universal
anxiety as to Major Denver. He had been their
doctor for a year before the war, and in that time
had managed to endear himself to everybody.</p>

<p>It was said he had taken a country practice because
he thought the bracing air would be good
for Chris. Every soul in the village felt a special
right to know the latest news of the major, and
Miss Radley had the telegrams pinned on the
front door as soon as she got them.</p>

<p>All day long people came up the drive to read
these telegrams, and presently there was a bit of
white paper as well, concerning Chris, for the
doctor&#8217;s little son lay grievously sick at home,
while his father, they feared, was dying of his
wounds in France. A white-capped hospital nurse
had come to help Miss Radley.</p>

<p>Easter was a very lonely little girl. She felt,
too, that in some inexplicable fashion she was shut
out from things, that more was happening than
she was allowed to know; and, worst of all, Chris
had so entirely disappeared that she began to fear
that he, too, was lost, and they were afraid to tell
her.</p>

<p>At the end of nearly a week she felt she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
not bear this furtiveness and suspense a minute
longer, and she determined to go to Chris&#8217;s house
and find out for herself just what had happened
and was happening. She would not ring the bell.
She would go round to the side of the house and
see if the schoolroom window was open, and get
in and find Miss Radley and force her to tell the
truth. If Chris was lost, then she, Easter, must
herself set forth to find him without more delay.</p>

<p>All fell out as she had planned.</p>

<p>The schoolroom window, which opened like a
door divided down the middle, was open, and Miss
Radley, with her back to it, sat at the table,
writing.</p>

<p>Easter could move quietly as a cat when it
suited her. She came in without making a sound,
and stood just behind Miss Radley, who was so
absorbed she noticed nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you lost Chris, Miss Radley?&#8221; Easter
asked loudly.</p>

<p>Miss Radley started violently, and Easter came
round to her side, and she noticed that Miss Radley&#8217;s
usually round, rosy face was pale and much
less round than it used to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Easter dear, how you startled me! Don&#8217;t
suggest such a dreadful thing! We&#8217;re awfully
anxious, with his mother away and all this other
trouble, but ... we must hope always, always
hope&mdash;for if anything happened to Chris....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>has</i> happened to Chris?&#8221; Easter asked,
searching the very soul of Miss Radley with her
large clear gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;He got so wet after he left you that day last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
week&mdash;I can&#8217;t think how&mdash;and he got a real bad
chill, and now there are all sorts of complications&mdash;and
his temperature keeps up so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are complications?&#8221; Easter interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t understand.... Oh, Easter,
child, don&#8217;t stare at me like that! Aren&#8217;t you
sorry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how Chris got so wet,&#8221; Easter said
slowly. &#8220;I pushed him into the ditch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Radley drew back a little from Easter;
then she put out her hand and laid it on the child&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect it was only in fun ... you couldn&#8217;t
know....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I play with him a bit? Is it catching?&#8221;
Easter&#8217;s voice was still quite loud and matter-of-fact.
&#8220;It&#8217;s rather dull and lonely for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For <i>you</i>!&#8221; Miss Radley echoed indignantly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand? Don&#8217;t you care, you
hard child? But you never did care for anybody
but yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Chris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed he does. He&#8217;s always been a dear,
kind boy. Easter, you must go home. I can&#8217;t stop
to talk to you now. Try to think about other people
a little....&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Radley did not finish her sentence, for
Easter had gone from her as silently as she had
come. For a minute the governess sat quite still.
Then she sighed and shivered, and went on with
her letter.</p>

<p>Easter fled down the Denvers&#8217; drive and out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the road, but she didn&#8217;t go home. She ran and
ran till she could run no more, and dropping into
a walk, turned downhill along a winding lane
thickly bordered by trees so high that they almost
met overhead, forming an arch. The light in this
avenue was curiously lurid, for the trees were
beeches, and though rapidly thinning, were still
gorgeous in reds and yellows. The avenue led to
a church in the next parish (Easter had run such
a long way), and she had been there quite lately
with Chris to a fruit and flower service in aid of
the local hospital. Miss Radley had taken them
both, and now Easter remembered there were very
large vegetable marrows at the base of one of the
pillars, and wondered if they were still there.
She and Chris had sat next each other at that
service, and during the sermon he had let her hold
his knife. It had a corkscrew and a thing for
taking stones out of horses&#8217; hoofs, as well as
blades, and all were very difficult to open. Chris
was good about lending his things. And he never
told of people. What did old Raddles mean when
she called her hard? She did care for Chris,
but she wasn&#8217;t going to say so to Raddles. Yet
Raddles looked awfully sad. Supposing they <i>had</i>
lost Chris, after all, and were afraid to say? Supposing
she, Easter, got lost, now, to-day? This
was a long, lonely, unfamiliar road, with such a
queer light in it. Supposing it were enchanted
and she couldn&#8217;t find her way back? Then she
would be like all those sons she had heard about
lately. Her heart began to beat very fast. Ah!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
somebody was coming up the road. She would
ask her way. It would be dreadful to be lost.</p>

<p>A very tall lady came toward her walking
slowly up the hill. She was dressed in black, with
a long thin veil turned back from her face. She
looked restlessly from side to side, as though trying
to find somebody in the shadows. This
seemed quite natural to Easter. Timidity or shyness
with strangers was unknown to her. She
was glad to see somebody, and the tall lady&#8217;s face
was very gentle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have <i>you</i> lost anybody?&#8221; Easter asked as they
met.</p>

<p>The tall lady stopped, and though she looked
straight down at Easter, the child was uncomfortably
conscious that she didn&#8217;t really see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lost my only son,&#8221; said the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too!&#8221; cried Easter, and what she could
not say to Miss Radley she found it easy to say
now to this pale lady who looked at her so
strangely. &#8220;Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she took one of the lady&#8217;s hands in both
her own.</p>

<p>The lady did not draw her hand away; with her
eyes still fixed on Easter&#8217;s face with that queer,
unseeing look, she said: &#8220;Dear child! And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Easter. &#8220;Not yet&mdash;at least,
they say so, but I&#8217;m dreadfully afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; said the lady. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
afraid. That&#8217;s what he always said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone,&#8221; said Easter, and her hard little
voice grew soft, &#8220;everyone seems losing sons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
people. Won&#8217;t you never, never find him again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Into that lady&#8217;s face there leapt a sudden radiance
as when a clearly burning lamp is carried into
a dark room. Her eyes were luminous and bright,
and Easter felt that she was really seeing her at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall all find them again,&#8221; she said almost
joyously. &#8220;Everyone of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; Easter questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;In sure and certain hope,&#8221; said the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;In sure and certain hope,&#8221; Easter repeated.
&#8220;I like that. You <i>are</i> sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. Tell me, dear, who is it you are
anxious about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hand in hand they had started slowly to mount
the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Chris,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He plays with me a
lot and we do lessons together ... and they
won&#8217;t let me see him, and I want to tell him I&#8217;m
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why won&#8217;t they let you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they&#8217;re afraid they&#8217;ll lose him&mdash;I
heard <i>that</i>, though Raddles denied it when I asked
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady looked curiously at Easter. There was
no doubt whatever that she was troubled, and yet
... how oddly the child spoke.</p>

<p>As they walked on, hand in hand, the lady said,
more to herself than to Easter: &#8220;Does the road
wind uphill all the way?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Easter; &#8220;when we get to the end
of this it&#8217;s quite flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they came to the main road Easter took
her hand out of the lady&#8217;s. &#8220;I know my way
now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady stooped and kissed her. &#8220;I should
write to Chris if I were you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
probably like a letter very much when he&#8217;s a little
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Easter nodded and started to run, with that
swift, long-distance, steady running that had so
often worn out Chris; that was his admiration and
his despair. And as she ran she repeated over
and over again: &#8220;In sure and certain hope&#8221; all
the way.</p>

<p>She would write to Chris directly she got in.
Her copies were always neater than his.</p>

<p>But she couldn&#8217;t do it the minute she got in,
for tea was ready, and her mother there to have
it with her. Her mother looked pleased, too. Better
news had come from France. There was hope
that Major Denver might pull through, after all;
and she had seen Miss Radley, and Chris&#8217;s temperature
was nearly down to normal.</p>

<p>It was a lovely tea; and directly after it Easter
sat down at her mother&#8217;s desk and wrote to Chris.
Very large, with beautiful up-and-down strokes:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Chris</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sory I pushed you. Sum of them shall

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Your loving</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Easter</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>She licked the flap of the envelope with copious
completeness, and in one corner of the address,
very thick and black, in inch-long printed letters
was the word &#8220;<span class="smcap">Eargunt.</span>&#8221;</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
